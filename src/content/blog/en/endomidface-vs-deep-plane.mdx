faq:
  - question: "Does Endomidface replace Deep Plane?"
    answer: "No. They are complementary techniques that solve different problems. Endomidface focuses on the midface (malar, nasolabial fold) with vertical vectors. Deep Plane focuses on the lower third (jowl, jawline, neck) with oblique vectors. Many patients benefit from both combined."
  - question: "Which technique is safer?"
    answer: "Endomidface works in the subperiosteal plane, deep to the facial nerve, offering inherent protection. Deep Plane works in the sub-SMAS plane, crossing the facial nerve zone. Both are safe in experienced hands. Dr. Brandão's record shows zero permanent injuries in 1,500+ Endomidface cases."
  - question: "Can I combine Endomidface with Deep Plane?"
    answer: "Yes, and this combination is often ideal. Endomidface addresses the midface while Deep Neck (Modern Face version of cervical Deep Plane) addresses the neck. Dr. Brandão teaches both techniques in his mentorship programs."
  - question: "Which technique has faster recovery?"
    answer: "Isolated Endomidface has faster recovery (7-10 days for social activities) due to more limited dissection and local anesthesia. Extensive Deep Plane may require 2-3 weeks. When combined, recovery reflects the more extensive procedure."
  - question: "For a 50-year-old patient with nasolabial fold, which technique?"
    answer: "If the main problem is nasolabial fold and malar ptosis, Endomidface is probably the best choice. If there's also significant jowl, consider combining with Deep Neck. Individual assessment is essential — not all facial ptosis is equal."

## Why This Comparison Is Necessary?
In the world of facial surgery, there's a tendency to polarize techniques: "my technique
is the best, others are inferior." This doesn't help patients or surgeons.
The reality is more nuanced. **Direct Vision Endomidface** and **traditional Deep Plane** solve different anatomical problems, work in different planes, and have different risk-benefit
profiles. Choosing the right technique depends on the patient, not dogmatic preference.
This article offers an objective analysis — with data when available — to help in
clinical decision-making. The perspective is from [Dr. Robério Brandão, creator of Endomidface, who also teaches when Deep Plane is the right choice.

## Detailed Analysis
### 1. Anatomical Focus: Where Each Technique Acts
#### ENDOMIDFACE
Focus on the **midface**: malar region, zygomatic eminence, nasolabial
fold, lower eyelid. Works in the subperiosteal space to vertically elevate the
descended malar complex.
**Ideal for:** Malar ptosis, tear trough, deep nasolabial fold
#### DEEP PLANE
Focus on the **lower third**: SMAS, platysma, jowl, mandibular contour,
neck. Works in the sub-SMAS plane to reposition the superficial musculoaponeurotic
system.
**Ideal for:** Severe jowl, loss of mandibular contour, cervical laxity
This difference in focus explains why the techniques are complementary: a patient with
malar ptosis AND jowl may need both.
### 2. Safety: Relationship with the Facial Nerve
This is perhaps the most clinically significant difference:
- 
ENDOMIDFACE:
The subperiosteal plane is *deep* to the facial nerve branches. You never cross
the nerve risk zone during dissection. This confers inherent protection to the technique.
- 
DEEP PLANE:
The sub-SMAS plane *crosses* the zone where the zygomatic, buccal and mandibular
branches of the facial nerve are located. Safe dissection requires precise anatomical
knowledge and meticulous technique.
#### 
📊 Safety Data — Endomidface (Dr. Robério Brandão)
- • **Total cases:** 1,500+
- • **Permanent nerve injury:** 0 (zero)
- • **Temporary weakness:** &lt;2% (complete resolution)
- • **Significant hematoma:** &lt;1%
### 3. Modern Face: The Biostimulator Factor
Here is a significant advantage of Endomidface that is often not discussed:
The Modern Face patient — one who has already received fillers and biostimulators — has altered tissue planes. The
sub-SMAS, where Deep Plane works, may be compromised by fibrosis, granulomas and unpredictable
adhesions.
The subperiosteal space, where Endomidface works, **is rarely affected** by injectable
treatments (which remain more superficial). This makes Endomidface particularly suitable for
the contemporary patient.
### 4. Vectors: Vertical vs Oblique
The vector difference has important aesthetic implications:
- 
Vertical (Endomidface):
Lifts where gravity pulls down. More natural result, without lateral tension that
creates the "pulled look".
- 
Oblique-lateral (Deep Plane):
Repositions SMAS posteriorly and superiorly. Effective for jowl but can create
lateral tension if poorly executed.

## When to Choose Each Technique
### ✅ Choose ENDOMIDFACE when:
- • Main problem is midface
- • Deep nasolabial fold
- • Flat or descended malar
- • Patient with history of injectables
- • Preference for fast recovery
- • Wants to avoid general anesthesia
- • Age 45-65 with moderate aging
### ✅ Choose DEEP PLANE when:
- • Main problem is jowl/jawline
- • Significant SMAS redundancy
- • Important cervical laxity
- • Patient 65+ with advanced aging
- • Significant excess skin
- • Virgin tissue (no previous injectables)
- • Willingness for longer recovery
### 🔄 Consider COMBINING when:
- • Patient has malar ptosis AND significant jowl
- • Aging affects midface AND lower third
- • Patient wants comprehensive result in one surgery
- • Anatomy allows safe combined approach
The Combo Legacy](/en/about/dr-roberio-brandao) from Modern
Face Institute teaches exactly this strategic combination.

## Frequently Asked Questions


## Conclusion: The Decision Is Individual
There is no universally superior technique. Endomidface excels in the midface,
especially in Modern Face patients. Deep Plane excels in the lower third and neck,
especially in significant redundancy. Complete surgeons master both — and know when to
use each.
The [Modern Face Institute teaches this complete approach: not just the Endomidface technique, but the decision framework
to select the correct approach for each patient.

Face.
