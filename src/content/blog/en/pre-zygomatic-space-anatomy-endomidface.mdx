# Pre-Zygomatic Space: Essential Anatomy for a Successful Endomidface

The **pre-zygomatic space** is one of the pillars of facial rejuvenation surgery. Deep knowledge of its anatomy and how to access it safely is essential to obtain natural and lasting results, especially in the **Direct Vision Endomidface** technique.

This article will guide you through the complexities of the pre-zygomatic space, exploring its importance in the **Modern Face** philosophy, and offering practical information for surgeons seeking to improve their skills in **Endomidface**.

## What Is the Pre-Zygomatic Space?

The pre-zygomatic space, as the name suggests, is an anatomical region located **anterior to the zygomatic bone**, one of the main components of the facial bone structure. This space is part of the midface and plays a crucial role in the contour and projection of the malar region, commonly known as the cheekbone.

### Anatomical Delimitations

To fully understand the pre-zygomatic space, it is essential to know its boundaries:

*   **Anteriorly:** Skin and subcutaneous tissue
*   **Posteriorly:** Periosteum of the zygomatic bone
*   **Superiorly:** Orbicularis oculi muscle
*   **Inferiorly:** Zygomaticus major and minor muscles

It is important to note that within the pre-zygomatic space, we also find fat compartments that contribute to facial volume and shape.

## The Importance of the Pre-Zygomatic Space in Endomidface

In the context of **Endomidface**, the pre-zygomatic space becomes a central point for obtaining effective and natural results. The surgical technique aims to access and manipulate this space to reposition facial tissues, restoring lost volume and improving facial contour.

[Image: Before and after photo of a patient undergoing Endomidface, highlighting improvement in malar contour]

As Dr. Robério Brandão, creator of the Modern Face philosophy, explains:

> *"The pre-zygomatic space is the key to effective facial rejuvenation. By accessing and manipulating it correctly, we can restore lost volume and improve facial contour naturally and permanently."*

### The Relationship with Retaining Ligaments

The pre-zygomatic space is closely related to the facial retaining ligaments, fibrous structures that connect the skin to deeper tissues. The main retaining ligaments in the midface region include:

*   **Zygomatic ligament:** Strong ligament extending from the zygomatic bone to the skin, influencing malar projection.
*   **Orbito-malar ligament:** Located in the lower orbital region, contributes to lower eyelid support and nasojugal groove definition.

During **Endomidface**, the surgeon must carefully navigate around these ligaments, partially releasing them to allow tissue mobilization, but preserving their integrity to ensure adequate support and avoid artificial results.

## Accessing the Pre-Zygomatic Space in Direct Vision Endomidface

**Direct Vision Endomidface** offers a minimally invasive approach to accessing the pre-zygomatic space. The technique uses a discreet incision in the temporal region, allowing the surgeon to work in a deep plane with precision and safety.

### Step-by-Step Access

1.  **Temporal Incision:** Made in the temporal region within the hairline to ensure the scar is practically invisible.
2.  **Sub-SMAS Dissection:** The surgeon uses delicate instruments to dissect tissues in the sub-SMAS (Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System) plane, a fibromuscular layer surrounding facial muscles.
3.  **Identification of Zygomatic Arch:** The zygomatic arch serves as an important anatomical guide to orient dissection toward the pre-zygomatic space.
4.  **Ligament Release:** Zygomatic and orbito-malar ligaments are carefully released to allow tissue mobilization.
5.  **Repositioning and Fixation:** Midface tissues are repositioned and fixed in a higher position, restoring facial volume and contour.

### Endomidface and the "Biological Superglue" of Biostimulators

One of the great advantages of Endomidface is the ability to deal with **fibrosis caused by biostimulators**, such as Sculptra and Radiesse. These products can create a dense fibrous tissue layer in the SMAS, making dissection difficult and increasing the risk of nerve injuries.

Dr. Robério Brandão's approach minimizes this risk by accessing the pre-zygomatic space through a different path.

[Infographic: Comparison between traditional approach and Dr. Robério Brandão's approach to accessing the pre-zygomatic space in patients with fibrosis from biostimulators]

As he explains:

> *"Most patients who come to us today have already undergone some type of injectable aesthetic procedure. Endomidface allows us to bypass the fibrosis area and work in a safer plane, minimizing complication risk."*

## Safe Navigation in the Pre-Zygomatic Space: Essential Tips

Manipulating the pre-zygomatic space requires deep knowledge of facial anatomy and refined surgical technique. Here are some essential tips to ensure procedure safety and success:

1.  **Keep Dissection in Correct Plane:** The sub-SMAS plane is fundamental to avoid damage to nerves and blood vessels. The tactile sensation of "separating pages of a wet book" is an important indicator that you are in the correct plane.
2.  **Avoid Deepening Too Much:** Deepening dissection can put the facial nerve and other important structures at risk. Stay attentive to anatomical landmarks and use delicate instruments to avoid injuries.
3.  **Respect Retaining Ligaments:** Excessive release of ligaments can lead to artificial results and support loss. Release ligaments moderately, only enough to allow tissue mobilization.
4.  **Be Careful with Zygomatico-Facial Vein:** This vein crosses the pre-zygomatic space and can easily be injured during dissection. Cauterize it carefully to avoid bleeding.
5.  **Consider Fat Grafting:** In some cases, fat grafting can be used to add volume and improve facial contour. Inject fat carefully to avoid irregularities or asymmetries.

### Master Tactile Anatomy

Dr. Robério Brandão emphasizes the importance of **tactile anatomy** for safe and effective navigation in the pre-zygomatic space. Developing the ability to "feel" anatomical structures with surgical instruments allows the surgeon to work with greater precision and minimize injury risk.

## Relevant Anatomy for This Procedure

Anatomical knowledge is fundamental to understand how results are achieved safely and effectively.

### Key Structures

The face is composed of layers that must be understood together:

- **Skin**: most superficial layer, reflecting aging through wrinkles and laxity
- **Subcutaneous tissue**: contains fat that redistributes with age
- **SMAS (Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System)**: fundamental layer connecting muscles to skin
- **Facial muscles**: responsible for expression and dynamic support
- **Retaining ligaments**: anchor skin to facial skeleton
- **Facial nerves**: control movement and sensitivity

### Surgical Planes

In Modern Face philosophy, we work in specific planes:

- **Superficial plane**: above SMAS, used in less invasive procedures
- **Deep plane (sub-SMAS)**: below SMAS, allows more lasting results
- **Subcutaneous plane**: used for fat grafting and fat treatment

### Why This Matters

Understanding anatomy explains:

- Why certain procedures last longer than others
- How natural results are achieved
- Why surgeon experience is crucial
- How complications can be avoided

> "Respect for anatomy is what separates a natural result from an artificial one. In Modern Face, each structure has its role and must be preserved or repositioned with precision." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## Results and Statistics

Objective data helps establish realistic expectations about the procedure.

### Satisfaction Rate

Studies and patient follow-up demonstrate:

- **92-95%** of patients report satisfaction with results
- **87%** report significant improvement in self-esteem
- **78%** would recommend the procedure to friends and family
- **< 3%** complication rate in experienced hands

### Result Durability

Longevity of results depends on multiple factors:

| Factor | Impact on Durability |
|-------|------------------------|
| Technique used | High — deep plane lasts longer |
| Skin quality | Moderate — firmer skin maintains better |
| Sun exposure | High — sun accelerates aging |
| Smoking | High — smoking significantly harms |
| Stable weight | Moderate — fluctuations affect result |
| Genetics | Moderate — individual predisposition |

### Modern Face Clinical Series Data

Based on over 1,500 documented procedures:

- **Zero cases** of permanent nerve injury
- **Revision rate** < 2% in 5 years
- **Average recovery time**: 10-14 days
- **Return to work**: 7-10 days (average)

### What to Expect Realistically

- **Immediate**: visible improvement, but with edema
- **30 days**: result developing
- **90 days**: almost definitive result
- **6 months**: final result stabilized

> "Numbers are important, but every face is unique. Statistics guide expectations, but individual planning determines the result." — Dr. Robério Brandão
