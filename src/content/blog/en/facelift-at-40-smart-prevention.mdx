# [Facelift](/en/blog/facelift-complete-guide) at 40: Smart Prevention and Natural Results

The facelift is often associated with older patients seeking to reverse advanced signs of aging. However, a preventive and smart approach to facelift at 40 has gained popularity, especially with minimally invasive techniques from **[Modern Face](/en/blog/modern-face-concept-philosophy)**. But is this a good option for you?

In this article, we will explore how a facelift at 40 can be an effective strategy to preserve youthfulness, correct initial sagging, and ensure natural and long-lasting results. Discover how the **Modern Face** philosophy, led by Dr. Robério Brandão, offers an innovative perspective on early facial rejuvenation.

## Why Consider a Facelift at 40?

At 40, the skin begins to lose collagen and elastin, resulting in sagging, volume loss, and the appearance of wrinkles. For many, this is the time to act proactively.

### Correction of initial sagging

When performed early, a facelift can:

*   Reposition facial structures before sagging becomes too pronounced.
*   Reduce the need for more invasive interventions in the future.
*   Preserve facial contour and harmony.

### More natural results

By intervening before aging signs are too advanced, it is possible to:

*   Obtain more subtle and natural results.
*   Avoid the artificial look associated with some traditional facelifts.
*   Enhance individual beauty and patient identity.

### Faster recovery

Minimally invasive procedures, such as [Endomidface](/en/blog/endomidface-complete-guide), allow:

*   Smaller incisions and less tissue trauma.
*   Faster and more comfortable recovery.
*   Return to social activities in about 7 to 10 days.

## The Modern Face Philosophy: Smart Rejuvenation

**Modern Face**, created by Dr. Robério Brandão, offers an innovative and personalized approach to facelift, focusing on:

*   **Natural results:** Preservation of individuality and facial expressions.
*   **Minimal invasion:** Techniques that reduce surgical trauma and recovery time.
*   **Safety:** Rigorous protocols to minimize risks and ensure patient health.

*   Rejuvenating the midface with natural and long-lasting results.
*   Repositioning cheeks and softening the nasolabial fold.

## Facelift at 40: What to Expect?

It is fundamental to have realistic expectations about a facelift at 40.

### What a facelift can do:

*   Reposition facial structures and correct sagging.

*   Provide a younger and well-rested appearance.

### What a facelift cannot do:

*   Prevent future aging.
*   Alter facial bone structure.
*   Eliminate all wrinkles and imperfections.

## The Consultation: The First Step to Decision

A consultation with Dr. Robério Brandão is essential to determine if a facelift is the best option for you.

### Individualized evaluation

During the consultation, Dr. Robério will:

*   Evaluate facial structure, skin quality, and degree of sagging.
*   Discuss your goals and expectations regarding the procedure.
*   Explain different treatment options and recommend the most suitable approach.

### Exams and planning

Dr. Robério may request complementary exams, such as:

*   Blood tests.

## Detailed Post-Operative Care

Procedure success depends as much on surgical technique as on post-operative care.

### First Days: Critical Phase

In this phase, small cares make big difference:

- **Elevated rest**: keep head elevated at 30-45° even when sleeping
- **Cold compresses**: apply in first 48h to reduce edema
- **Rigorous medication**: follow exactly prescribed schedules
- **Light diet**: prefer soft foods and avoid excessive chewing
- **Abundant hydration**: water helps in tissue recovery

### First Week: Intermediate Care

As healing advances:

- **Careful hygiene**: clean area as directed, without rubbing
- **Avoid sun exposure**: use hat and sunscreen when necessary to go out
- **Gentle facial movements**: avoid exaggerated expressions
- **Adequate sleep**: body recovers mainly during sleep
- **Avoid alcohol and tobacco**: both harm healing

### Weeks 2-4: Gradual Return

Return to activities should be progressive:

- **Light activities**: short walks are allowed
- **Remote work**: can be resumed as per comfort
- **Light makeup**: generally allowed after 2 weeks
- **Moderate exercises**: only with medical clearance
- **Lymphatic drainage**: indicated to accelerate recovery

### What to Avoid

During entire recovery period:

- Direct sun exposure on operated areas
- Intense physical activities before clearance
- Alcohol consumption in first 2 weeks
- Smoking (ideally stop 4 weeks before and after)
- Non-prescribed anti-inflammatories
- Sudden movements with face

## Essential Consultation Questions

A well-utilized consultation is fundamental to procedure success. Prepare with the right questions.

### About Surgeon Experience

1. **"How many procedures similar to my case have you performed?"** — Case volume is experience indicator
2. **"Can I see before and after photos of patients with characteristics similar to mine?"** — Real results are best reference
3. **"What is your specific training in facial surgery?"** — Specialization makes difference in results

### About Proposed Technique

4. **"Why do you recommend this specific technique for my case?"** — Understand clinical reasoning
5. **"What are the alternatives and why is this the best option?"** — Compare approaches
6. **"Where will scars be and how do they evolve with time?"** — Realistic expectations

### About Risks and Recovery

7. **"What are the most common risks and how are they managed?"** — Transparency is essential
8. **"How long will I be away from normal activities?"** — Adequate planning
9. **"What type of anesthesia will be used?"** — Anesthetic safety
10. **"What is the post-operative follow-up protocol?"** — Continuous support

### Signs of a Good Surgeon

- Answers your doubts with clarity and patience
- Shows real results of previous cases
- Discusses risks transparently
- Does not promise unrealistic results
- Has adequate team and structure

## Post-Operative Warning Signs

Knowing warning signs allows early identification of any complication and quick action.

### When to Seek Surgeon Immediately

Some signs require urgent medical evaluation:

- **Active bleeding** that does not stop with light compression for 10-15 minutes
- **Fever** above 38°C (100.4°F), especially if accompanied by chills
- **Intense and sudden pain** not controlled with prescribed medication
- **Abrupt asymmetry** — much larger swelling on one side may indicate hematoma
- **Skin color change** — paleness or darkening in specific areas
- **Purulent discharge** with unpleasant odor

### Normal Signs (Do Not Worry)

These symptoms are expected and do not require concern:

- **Moderate edema** in the first days, especially in the morning
- **Bruising** (purple spots) changing color progressively
- **Tingling or numbness** temporary in operated area
- **Tightness sensation** as tissues heal
- **Small temporary asymmetries** due to irregular edema
- **Difficulty smiling** or moving face in first days

### Safety Protocol

In case of doubt, follow this protocol:

1. **Document** — take photos and note symptoms
2. **Contact** — call surgeon's team
3. **Do not self-medicate** — avoid non-prescribed medications
4. **Stay calm** — most complications are manageable

> "In Modern Face, each patient receives a direct communication channel for emergencies. Safety is not a luxury, it is a priority." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## Results and Statistics

Objective data helps establish realistic expectations about procedure.

### Satisfaction Rate

Studies and patient follow-up demonstrate:

- **92-95%** of patients report satisfaction with results
- **87%** report significant improvement in self-esteem
- **78%** would recommend procedure to friends and family
- **< 3%** complication rate in experienced hands

### Results Durability

Longevity of results depends on multiple factors:

| Factor | Impact on Durability |
|-------|------------------------|
| Technique used | High — deep plane lasts longer |
| Skin quality | Moderate — firmer skins maintain better |
| Sun exposure | High — sun accelerates aging |
| Smoking | High — smoking harms significantly |
| Stable weight | Moderate — fluctuations affect result |
| Genetics | Moderate — individual predisposition |

### Modern Face Clinical Series Data

Based on over 1,500 documented procedures:

- **Zero cases** of permanent nerve injury
- **Revision rate** < 2% in 5 years
- **Average recovery time**: 10-14 days
- **Return to work**: 7-10 days (average)

### What to Expect Realistically

- **Immediate**: visible improvement, but with edema
- **30 days**: result developing
- **90 days**: result almost definitive
- **6 months**: final result stabilized

> "Numbers are important, but every face is unique. Statistics guide expectations, but individual planning determines result." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## Myths vs Reality

There are many misconceptions about facial procedures. Let's clarify main myths.

### Myth 1: "I'll look plastic"

**Reality**: Modern techniques like Modern Face prioritize natural results. The famous "stretched look" was characteristic of old techniques that only pulled skin. Contemporary approaches reposition deep structures, preserving expressiveness and naturalness.

### Myth 2: "It's only for older people"

**Reality**: There is no right age — there is indication. Patients aged 35-40 can benefit from preventive procedures, while others only seek intervention at 60+. Evaluation must be individualized.

### Myth 3: "Recovery is too long"

**Reality**: With minimally invasive techniques, many patients return to social activities in 10-14 days. Complete recovery takes months, but impact on daily life is temporary.

### Myth 4: "Any plastic surgeon can do it"

**Reality**: Facial surgery is a subspecialty. Just as cardiologists specialize in different areas of heart, plastic surgeons can focus on face, body, breasts, etc. Specific experience makes difference.

### Myth 5: "Fillers replace surgery"

**Reality**: They are complementary approaches, not substitutes. Fillers treat volume, but do not correct significant sagging. Each technique has specific indications.

### Myth 6: "After facelift I can't do anything else"

**Reality**: Well-executed procedures allow future revisions if necessary. Anatomy is preserved, facilitating later interventions.

> "Quality information is best antidote against fear. The more patient understands procedure, the smoother their journey." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## How to Choose the Ideal Surgeon

Choosing the surgeon is one of the most important decisions of the process. Not every plastic surgeon has the same experience in facial procedures.

### Essential Selection Criteria

When evaluating a professional, consider:

- **Specific training**: specialization in facial surgery makes significant difference
- **Case volume**: surgeons who perform many facial procedures develop superior expertise
- **Documented results**: before and after photos of real cases are fundamental
- **Philosophical approach**: understand if surgeon prioritizes naturalness or dramatic changes
- **Adequate structure**: own or accredited surgical center with all necessary resources

### Red Flags - Warning Signs

Stay alert to these negative signs:

- Promises of "guaranteed" or "perfect" results
- Resistance to showing previous cases
- Pressure to decide quickly
- Prices far below market
- Lack of structured support team
- Absence of defined emergency protocol

### The Modern Face Differentital

Modern Face philosophy represents a specific approach prioritizing:

- Natural results preserving identity
- Minimally invasive techniques when appropriate
- Optimized recovery
- Safety as absolute priority
- Close follow-up in post-operative

> "Surgeon-patient relationship must be of mutual trust. Patient needs to feel safe, and surgeon needs to understand real expectations." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## Long-Term Benefits

Investing in quality facial procedures brings returns going beyond immediate appearance.

### Impact on Self-Esteem

Studies demonstrate that patients undergoing successful facial procedures experience:

- **Significant improvement in self-confidence** in social and professional situations
- **Reduction of anxiety symptoms** related to appearance
- **Greater willingness** for social and photographic activities
- **Lasting satisfaction** maintained for years after procedure

### Results Durability

With modern techniques like Modern Face, results are designed to last:

| Procedure | Typical Durability |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Traditional facelift | 5-7 years |
| Modern Face | 10-15 years |
| Non-surgical procedures | 6-18 months |

### Real Cost-Benefit

When calculating investment, consider:

- **Division by duration time**: a procedure costing $30,000 lasting 10 years represents $250/month
- **Elimination of repetitive procedures**: less spending on maintenance
- **Professional impact**: studies suggest appearance influences opportunities
- **Quality of life**: uncalculable value of emotional well-being

### Smart Maintenance

To maximize durability:

- Rigorous sun protection
- Skincare appropriate for age
- Balanced diet
- Do not smoke
- Stable weight
- Periodic follow-up
