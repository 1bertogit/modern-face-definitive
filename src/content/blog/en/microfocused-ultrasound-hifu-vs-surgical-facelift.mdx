## Understanding Microfocused Ultrasound (Ulthera/HIFU)

**Microfocused ultrasound**, popularized by devices such as Ulthera and HIFU (High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound), is a non-invasive aesthetic treatment that uses ultrasound waves to stimulate collagen production in the deep layers of the skin.

### How Does It Work?

Microfocused ultrasound emits energy that heats specific points in the skin layers, including the SMAS (Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System), a fibromuscular structure that plays a fundamental role in facial support.

This controlled heating causes micro-injuries that stimulate the production of collagen and elastin, promoting skin firmness and tone over time.

### Benefits of Microfocused Ultrasound

*   **Non-invasive:** Requires no incisions or anesthesia.
*   **No recovery time:** The patient can return to normal activities immediately after the procedure.
*   **Improvement of skin firmness and tone:** Stimulates collagen production, resulting in firmer skin with less sagging.
*   **Gradual results:** Results become more visible over weeks and months as collagen is produced.
*   **Can be performed on different areas of the face and neck:** Versatile for treating various areas with sagging.

### Risks and Disadvantages of Microfocused Ultrasound

*   **Limited results:** Improvement in sagging is more subtle compared to surgical facelift.
*   **Multiple sessions may be necessary:** To optimize results, several sessions may be recommended.
*   **Does not correct excess skin:** Does not remove excess skin, only stimulates collagen production.
*   **May cause discomfort:** Some patients report feeling pain or discomfort during the procedure.
*   **Variable results:** Response to treatment may vary from person to person.

### What to Expect from the Treatment?

During the procedure, the doctor applies the device to the skin, emitting ultrasound pulses. The patient may feel heat or tingling. The session duration varies from 30 to 90 minutes, depending on the treated area.

After treatment, the skin may present slight redness or swelling, which usually disappear within a few hours.

## Understanding Surgical Facelift

The **surgical facelift**, also known as [rhytidoplasty](/en/blog/facelift-complete-guide), is a surgical procedure that aims to rejuvenate the face by repositioning facial tissues, removing excess skin, and restoring a more youthful contour.

### How Does It Work?

The surgical facelift involves incisions at the hairline and around the ears, allowing the surgeon to lift the skin and reposition underlying tissues, including the SMAS.

Excess skin is removed, and the remaining skin is tightened and sutured, resulting in a firmer face with less sagging.

### Benefits of Surgical Facelift

*   **Longer-lasting results:** Surgical facelift results can last many years, providing significant rejuvenation.
*   **Correction of sagging:** Repositions facial tissues, correcting sagging and restoring a more youthful contour.
*   **Visible results:** Offers a notable improvement in facial appearance.
*   **Comprehensive treatment:** Allows treating different areas of the face and neck in a single procedure.
*   **Can be combined with other procedures:** Can be combined with other procedures, such as [blepharoplasty](/en/blog/blepharoplasty-guide) and neck liposuction, for complete facial rejuvenation.

### Risks and Disadvantages of Surgical Facelift

*   **Invasive:** Requires incisions and anesthesia.
*   **Recovery time:** Recovery time varies from weeks to months.
*   **Scars:** Although incisions are made in discreet areas, scars are permanent.
*   **Surgical risks:** Like any surgery, presents risks of bleeding, infection, and reactions to anesthesia.
*   **Nerve injury:** There is a risk, although low, of nerve injury, which can result in numbness or muscle weakness.
*   **Artificial results:** If performed inadequately, can result in a face with an artificial or "stretched" look.

### The Modern Face Philosophy and Surgical Facelift

Dr. Robério Brandão, creator of the Modern Face philosophy, emphasizes the importance of a surgical facelift that respects facial anatomy and provides natural and long-lasting results.

"In Modern Face, the surgical facelift is not just about tightening the skin, but about repositioning deep tissues, restoring volume and facial contour in a harmonious way," states Dr. Robério.

The Endomidface technique, developed by Dr. Robério, is an example of how Modern Face seeks to optimize surgical facelift results, minimizing scars and recovery time.

## Alert Signs in Post-Operative Period

Knowing alert signs allows early identification of any complication and quick action.

### When to Seek Surgeon Immediately

Some signs require urgent medical evaluation:

- **Active bleeding** that does not stop with light compression for 10-15 minutes
- **Fever** above 38°C, especially if accompanied by chills
- **Intense and sudden pain** not controlled with prescribed medication
- **Abrupt asymmetry** — much larger swelling on one side may indicate hematoma

- **Purulent discharge** with unpleasant odor

### Normal Signs (Do Not Worry)

These symptoms are expected and do not require concern:

- **Moderate edema** in first days, especially in morning
- **Ecchymosis** (bruises) changing color progressively
- **Tingling or numbness** temporary in operated area
- **Tightness sensation** as tissues heal
- **Small temporary asymmetries** due to irregular edema
- **Difficulty smiling** or moving face in first days

### Safety Protocol

In case of doubt, follow this protocol:

1. **Document** — take photos and note symptoms
2. **Contact** — call surgeon's team
3. **Do not self-medicate** — avoid non-prescribed medications
4. **Stay calm** — most complications are manageable

## Anatomy Relevant to This Procedure

Anatomical knowledge is fundamental to understand how results are achieved safely and effectively.

### Key Structures

The face is composed of layers that must be understood together:

- **Skin**: most superficial layer, reflecting aging through wrinkles and sagging
- **Subcutaneous tissue**: contains fat that redistributes with age
- **SMAS (Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System)**: fundamental layer connecting muscles to skin
- **Facial muscles**: responsible for expression and dynamic support
- **Retaining ligaments**: anchor skin to facial skeleton
- **Facial nerves**: control movement and sensitivity

### Surgical Planes

In Modern Face philosophy, we work in specific planes:

- **Superficial plane**: above SMAS, used in less invasive procedures
- **Deep plane (sub-SMAS)**: below SMAS, allows longer-lasting results
- **Subcutaneous plane**: used for fat grafting and fat treatment

### Why This Matters

Understanding anatomy explains:

- Why certain procedures last longer than others
- How natural results are achieved
- Why surgeon's experience is crucial
- How complications can be avoided

> "Respect for anatomy is what separates a natural result from an artificial one. In Modern Face, each structure has its role and must be preserved or repositioned with precision." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## Conclusion

Both microfocused ultrasound and surgical facelift are effective options for facial rejuvenation, each with its advantages and disadvantages. Choosing the best procedure must be individualized, considering degree of sagging, patient expectations, and evaluation by a qualified professional.
