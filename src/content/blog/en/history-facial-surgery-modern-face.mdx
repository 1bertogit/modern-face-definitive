These initial procedures, although limited, represented the awakening of a new era in aesthetic surgery. The quest for more lasting and natural results would soon drive the development of more complex techniques, marking the birth of **rhytidectomy**, or [facelift](/en/blog/facelift-complete-guide).

### The Birth of Rhytidectomy

In the early 20th century, rhytidectomy began to take shape, driven by visionary surgeons seeking more comprehensive and lasting results. These pioneers recognized that simple skin excision was not enough to treat underlying sagging, and began exploring techniques to reposition deeper tissues.

Among names that stood out in this period, we find:

*   **Erich Lexer:** One of the first to perform facelifts with strategically positioned incisions to minimize visible scars.
*   **Suzanne Noël:** An advocate for rhytidectomy for women, who popularized the technique and contributed to its social acceptance.
*   **Raymond Passot:** An innovator who developed techniques to treat neck sagging in conjunction with the facelift.

These early surgeons, with their boldness and ingenuity, laid the foundations for modern facial surgery. Their techniques, although considered rudimentary by current standards, represented a significant leap from previous approaches.

This approach, known as **subcutaneous rhytidectomy**, became the gold standard for decades, offering more predictable and lasting results than previous techniques. However, subcutaneous rhytidectomy also presented its limitations:

*   Results were not yet totally natural, with risk of a "stretched" look.
*   Durability, although improved, was not yet ideal.
*   Lack of understanding of deeper anatomy resulted in significant nerve injury risk.

These challenges drove the search for techniques that could treat facial sagging more effectively and safely, marking the beginning of a new era in facial surgery.

## The Revolution of [SMAS](/en/blog/smas-anatomy-guide): A New Dimension of Support

The 1970s witnessed a revolution in facial surgery with the discovery of the **SMAS (Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System)**. Mitz and Barton, in 1976, described this fibromuscular layer as a crucial structure for facial support, paving the way for facelift techniques that could act in a deeper and more lasting plane.

[Infographic: Diagram showing location and importance of SMAS in facial anatomy]

From this discovery, various SMAS techniques emerged, each with its particularities:

*   **SMAS plication:** Involves suturing and shortening the SMAS, providing elevation of facial tissues.
*   **SMASectomy:** Removes a portion of the SMAS, allowing broader repositioning.
*   **Composite facelift:** Combines skin detachment with SMAS manipulation, offering a more extensive result.

These techniques, by acting in a deeper plane, provided more natural and lasting results than previous approaches. However, they also required deeper knowledge of facial anatomy and presented new technical challenges, such as nerve injury risk.

### The [Deep Plane](/en/blog/deep-plane-facelift-guide) Facelift: A Journey to the Deep Plane

The **Deep Plane Facelift**, developed by surgeons like Sam Hamra, marked significant advancement in the quest for even more natural and lasting results. This technique involves detaching skin and SMAS in a deep plane, allowing release of retaining ligaments of the face and more complete tissue repositioning.

The Deep Plane Facelift offers several advantages:

*   Natural results, without the stigma of a "stretched" face.
*   Enhanced durability, with results that can last for many years.
*   Effective treatment of midface sagging, an area difficult to approach with previous techniques.

However, the Deep Plane Facelift also presents significant challenges:

*   Technical complexity, requiring deep knowledge of facial anatomy and advanced surgical skills.
*   Increased nerve injury risk due to proximity to facial nerve.
*   Prolonged recovery time, with higher incidence of edema and bruising.

Despite these challenges, the Deep Plane Facelift established itself as one of the most effective techniques for facial rejuvenation, driving the search for even more refined and safe approaches.

## The Era of Mini-Invasiveness: Precision and Accelerated Recovery

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, facial surgery experienced a new wave of innovation with the emergence of **minimally invasive** techniques. These approaches, driven by technological advances and growing patient desire for results with shorter recovery time, sought to minimize scars and reduce surgical trauma.

Some of the most popular minimally invasive techniques include:

*   **MACS-lift (Minimal Access Cranial Suspension lift):** A technique using sutures to suspend facial tissues through small incisions.
*   **Thread lift:** Involves insertion of absorbable or non-absorbable threads under skin to lift and support facial tissues.
*   **Endoscopic facelift:** Uses an endoscope to visualize and manipulate facial tissues through small incisions.

These techniques, although less invasive, also present their limitations:

*   Results less predictable and lasting than traditional techniques.
*   Need for regular maintenance with additional procedures.
*   Risk of complications like skin irregularities and thread extrusion.

Despite these limitations, minimally invasive techniques opened a new horizon in facial surgery, driving the search for approaches combining precision of traditional surgery with accelerated recovery of minimally invasive techniques.

## Relevant Anatomy for This Procedure

Anatomical knowledge is fundamental to understand how results are achieved safely and effectively.

### Key Structures

The face is composed of layers that must be understood together:

- **Skin**: most superficial layer, reflecting aging through wrinkles and laxity
- **Subcutaneous tissue**: contains fat that redistributes with age
- **SMAS (Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System)**: fundamental layer connecting muscles to skin
- **Facial muscles**: responsible for expression and dynamic support
- **Retaining ligaments**: anchor skin to facial skeleton
- **Facial nerves**: control movement and sensitivity

### Surgical Planes

In Modern Face philosophy, we work in specific planes:

- **Superficial plane**: above SMAS, used in less invasive procedures
- **Deep plane (sub-SMAS)**: below SMAS, allows more lasting results
- **Subcutaneous plane**: used for fat grafting and fat treatment

### Why This Matters

Understanding anatomy explains:

- Why certain procedures last longer than others
- How natural results are achieved
- Why surgeon experience is crucial
- How complications can be avoided

> "Respect for anatomy is what separates a natural result from an artificial one. In Modern Face, each structure has its role and must be preserved or repositioned with precision." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## Conclusion

The history of facial surgery is a saga of constant quest for improvement. Modern Face, with its emphasis on safety, naturalness, and lasting results, represents the latest chapter of this story.
