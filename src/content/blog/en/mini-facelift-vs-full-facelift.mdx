## What is Mini Facelift?
Mini facelift is a less extensive version of facelift, focusing on specific areas with
smaller incisions. Ideal for patients with mild to moderate laxity who want faster
recovery.

## Which to Choose?
The choice depends on degree of aging, patient expectations and recovery availability. A
mini facelift in a patient with severe laxity will result in unsatisfactory outcome.
