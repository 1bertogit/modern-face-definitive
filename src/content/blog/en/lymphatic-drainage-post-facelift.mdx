faq:
  - question: "Is lymphatic drainage mandatory after facelift?"
    answer: "Not mandatory, but highly recommended. Drainage accelerates edema resolution, reduces discomfort and can improve final result. Many surgeons include it in postoperative protocol."
  - question: "When to start drainage after facelift?"
    answer: "Generally after 48-72 hours, when bleeding risk decreases. Exact timing varies per surgeon's guidance. Starting too early may be contraindicated; too late loses part of benefit."
  - question: "How many drainage sessions are necessary?"
    answer: "Typically 5-10 sessions in first 2-3 weeks, with decreasing frequency. Some patients benefit from additional sessions. Exact number depends on procedure extent and individual response."
  - question: "Does drainage hurt after facial surgery?"
    answer: "It shouldn't. Post-facelift drainage should be very gentle, respecting the operated area sensitivity. Aggressive techniques are contraindicated. If it hurts, communicate to therapist."
  - question: "Can I do drainage with any physiotherapist?"
    answer: "Ideally, with professional experienced in facial surgery postoperative care. Face technique differs from body. Many surgeons have specialized partner physiotherapists."
  - question: "Can drainage harm facelift result?"
    answer: "If done correctly, no. If done aggressively or too early, theoretically could cause problems. Hence the importance of qualified professional and surgeon's guidance."
  - question: "What else helps reduce edema besides drainage?"
    answer: "Sleep with head elevated (30-45°), cold compresses in first days, avoid excess salt, don't lower head, don't do physical effort. Drainage complements these measures."

## Why Lymphatic Drainage?
After any surgery, the body responds with inflammation — natural part of healing. In the
face, this inflammation manifests as edema (swelling) that can be uncomfortable and
delay final aesthetic result.
**Manual lymphatic drainage** is a gentle massage technique that stimulates the
lymphatic system to drain excess fluid accumulated in tissues. Result: less swelling, less
discomfort, faster recovery.

## Proven Benefits
#### ✓ Edema Reduction
Accelerates accumulated interstitial fluid reabsorption.
#### ✓ Discomfort Relief
Less tissue tension = less feeling of weight and pressure.
#### ✓ Circulation Improvement
Stimulates blood and lymphatic flow, oxygenating tissues.
#### ✓ Faster Result
Less time until seeing "real" procedure result.

## Typical Drainage Protocol

Period
Frequency
Notes

Days 3-7
Daily or alternate days
Maximum edema phase. Greatest benefit.

Week 2
2-3x per week
Edema decreasing. Reduced frequency.

Week 3-4
1-2x per week
Maintenance. As needed.

After week 4
As indicated
Some patients benefit from extra sessions.

Note: Protocol varies per surgeon's guidance and individual response. Follow your
doctor's specific instructions.

## Care and Precautions
#### Correct Timing
Don't start before 48-72h post-surgery (bleeding risk). Wait for surgeon clearance.
#### Gentle Pressure
Post-surgery facial drainage should be extremely delicate. Never strong pressure.
#### Qualified Professional
Seek physiotherapist with facial postoperative experience, not just body.
#### Surgeon Communication
Report any abnormality during sessions. Keep surgeon informed.
