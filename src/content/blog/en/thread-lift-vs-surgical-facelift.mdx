# Threads vs Facelift: What is the Best Option in 2025?

The quest for a rejuvenated face with defined contours leads many patients to question the available options. In 2025, two of the most popular procedures to combat facial sagging are **thread lifts** and **surgical facelift**, also known as rhytidectomy. But which one is right for you?

In this article, Dr. Robério Brandão, creator of the Modern Face philosophy and facial surgery specialist, offers a detailed comparative analysis between these two techniques. We will explore indications, expected results, durability, costs, and limitations of each procedure, so you can make an informed decision aligned with your goals and expectations.

The Modern Face philosophy prioritizes natural, lasting, and safe results, adapted to each patient's individual needs. Therefore, it is fundamental to understand the nuances of each technique and how they fit into this concept.

## Understanding Facial Sagging: What Threads and Facelift Can Correct

Facial sagging is a natural aging process, caused by the loss of collagen, elastin, and fat, in addition to gravity's action. This combination leads to the descent of facial structures, resulting in:

*   Loss of jawline definition
*   Accentuation of nasolabial fold (smile lines)
*   Drooping cheeks
*   Appearance of jowls
*   Neck with excess skin and fat

Both thread lifts and surgical facelift aim to reposition these tissues, restoring volume and facial definition. However, the approach and results of each technique are distinct.

### Thread Lifts: A Non-Surgical "Lift"

Thread lifts are absorbable or non-absorbable filaments, inserted into the skin through small incisions, with the goal of pulling and fixing tissues, promoting an immediate lifting effect.

There are different types of threads, such as PDO (polydioxanone), poly-L-lactic acid (Sculptra), and Silhouette Soft (with cones), each with specific characteristics and durabilities.

### Surgical Facelift: Lasting Structural Repositioning

Surgical facelift, on the other hand, is a more invasive procedure involving strategic incisions, skin dissection, and repositioning of deep face structures, such as the SMAS (Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System), the tissue layer supporting facial muscles.

The Modern Face philosophy, defended by Dr. Robério Brandão, prioritizes techniques acting on deep face layers, like [Endomidface](/en/blog/endomidface-complete-guide), to ensure more natural and lasting results.

## Thread Lifts: Pros and Cons

### Advantages of Thread Lifts:

*   **Minimally invasive procedure:** No need for extensive cuts or hospital stay.
*   **Rapid recovery:** Return to activities in a few days.
*   **Immediate results:** Visible lifting effect right after the procedure.
*   **More affordable cost:** Compared to surgical facelift.

### Disadvantages of Thread Lifts:

*   **Limited durability:** Results last, on average, 12 to 18 months, depending on thread type.
*   **Does not correct excess skin:** The technique only pulls tissues, without removing excess skin.
*   **Subtle results:** Lifting effect is more discreet than obtained with surgery.
*   **Does not act on deep structures:** The technique does not reposition the SMAS, only pulls the skin.
*   **Risk of complications:** Although rare, skin irregularities, thread extrusion, infection, and inflammation can occur.

### Ideal Candidates for Thread Lifts:

*   Patients with mild to moderate sagging.
*   Patients seeking subtle and quick facial rejuvenation.
*   Patients who do not wish or cannot undergo surgery.
*   Patients with good skin quality and no excess skin.

## Surgical Facelift: Pros and Cons

### Advantages of Surgical Facelift:

*   **Lasting results:** Lifting effect can last many years, depending on skin care and patient lifestyle.
*   **Excess skin correction:** The technique allows removing excess skin, providing a more complete result.
*   **Deep structure repositioning:** Surgical facelift acts on the SMAS, repositioning tissues more effectively.
*   **More expressive results:** Lifting effect is more evident and impactful than obtained with threads.

### Disadvantages of Surgical Facelift:

*   **Invasive procedure:** Requires cuts, skin dissection, and hospital stay.
*   **Longer recovery:** Return to activities may take a few weeks.
*   **Higher cost:** Compared to thread lifts.
*   **Risk of complications:** Although rare, hematomas, infection, nerve injury, and sensitivity changes can occur.

### Ideal Candidates for Surgical Facelift:

*   Patients with moderate to intense sagging.
*   Patients seeking complete and lasting facial rejuvenation.
*   Patients with excess skin.
*   Patients with good general health and willing to follow post-operative guidelines.

### Modern Face and Scar Minimization

In Modern Face philosophy, Dr. Robério Brandão seeks minimally invasive techniques providing natural and lasting results. The [Endomidface](/en/blog/endomidface-complete-guide) technique, for example, allows a midface lift with discreet incisions and expressive results.

## The Modern Face Philosophy: Prioritizing Lasting and Natural Results

Dr. Robério Brandão emphasizes that the choice between thread lifts and surgical facelift should be individualized, considering each patient's needs and expectations.

The Modern Face philosophy prioritizes:

*   **Lasting structural results:** Acting on deep face layers to reposition tissues effectively.
*   **Naturalness:** Avoiding artificial look and prioritizing facial harmony.
*   **Safety:** Minimizing risks and complications.
*   **Optimized recovery:** Seeking minimally invasive techniques allowing quick return to activities.

In this context, thread lifts can be a complementary option for patients with mild sagging or those desiring a subtle "upgrade" in facial contour.

## FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

### Do thread lifts replace surgical facelifts?
No, thread lifts do not replace surgical facelifts. They are indicated for different degrees of sagging and goals.

### What is the durability of thread lifts?
On average, 12 to 18 months, depending on thread type and patient characteristics.

### Does surgical facelift leave visible scars?
In Modern Face, scars are minimized and disguised, generally located in barely visible areas.

### Are thread lifts painful?
The procedure is minimally invasive and generally well tolerated, with local anesthesia.

### What is the best technique to treat jowls?
Surgical facelift, like Deep Neck, offers more effective results to treat jowls, as it acts on deep neck and jaw structures.

### Who is the ideal candidate for thread lifts?
Patients with mild to moderate sagging, no excess skin, and seeking subtle and quick rejuvenation.

### What is the Modern Face philosophy on threads?
We prioritize lasting structural results, but threads can complement other procedures for a more harmonious global result.

## What to Expect: Recovery Timeline

Recovery is a journey requiring patience and specific care in each phase. Knowing what to expect helps reduce anxiety and optimize results.

### First 24-48 Hours

This is the most delicate period. It is normal to present:
- **Moderate to intense edema**: swelling is maximum in this period
- **Bruising**: purple spots may appear and are a natural part of healing
- **Manageable discomfort**: pain is generally mild to moderate, controlled with prescribed painkillers
- **Need for absolute rest**: avoid sudden movements and keep head elevated

### First Week (Days 3-7)

From the third day, you will start noticing progressive improvements:
- Edema begins to decrease gradually
- Bruises change color (purple → green → yellow)
- Stitches and dressings may be removed as per medical advice
- Light activities can be resumed with caution

### Weeks 2-4

Important transition phase:
- Gradual return to social and professional activities
- Residual edema still present, but less noticeable
- Result begins to define itself, although not yet definitive
- Lymphatic drainage massages may be indicated

### Months 1-3

Final result consolidates progressively:
- Tissues settle into their definitive position
- Scars mature and become less visible
- Sensitivity returns gradually to normal
- Final result visible between 3-6 months

> "Patience is fundamental. The final result of a facial procedure can only be evaluated after 6 months, when all tissues have already stabilized." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## Post-Operative Warning Signs

Knowing warning signs allows early identification of any complication and quick action.

### When to Seek Surgeon Immediately

Some signs require urgent medical evaluation:
- **Active bleeding** that does not stop with light compression for 10-15 minutes
- **Fever** above 38°C (100.4°F), especially if accompanied by chills
- **Intense and sudden pain** not controlled with prescribed medication
- **Abrupt asymmetry** — much larger swelling on one side may indicate hematoma
- **Skin color change** — paleness or darkening in specific areas
- **Purulent discharge** with unpleasant odor

### Normal Signs (Do Not Worry)

These symptoms are expected and do not require concern:
- **Moderate edema** in the first days, especially in the morning
- **Bruising** (purple spots) changing color progressively
- **Tingling or numbness** temporary in operated area
- **Tightness sensation** as tissues heal
- **Small temporary asymmetries** due to irregular edema
- **Difficulty smiling** or moving face in first days

### Safety Protocol

In case of doubt, follow this protocol:
1. **Document** — take photos and note symptoms
2. **Contact** — call surgeon's team
3. **Do not self-medicate** — avoid non-prescribed medications
4. **Stay calm** — most complications are manageable

> "In Modern Face, each patient receives a direct communication channel for emergencies. Safety is not a luxury, it is a priority." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## Essential Questions for Consultation

A well-used consultation is fundamental for procedure success. Prepare with the right questions.

### About Surgeon Experience

1. **"How many procedures similar to my case have you performed?"** — Case volume is experience indicator
2. **"Can I see before and after photos of patients with characteristics similar to mine?"** — Real results are best reference
3. **"What is your specific training in facial surgery?"** — Specialization makes difference in results

### About Proposed Technique

4. **"Why do you recommend this specific technique for my case?"** — Understand clinical reasoning
5. **"What are the alternatives and why is this the best option?"** — Compare approaches
6. **"Where will scars be and how do they evolve over time?"** — Realistic expectations

### About Risks and Recovery

7. **"What are the most common risks and how are they managed?"** — Transparency is essential
8. **"How long will I be away from normal activities?"** — Proper planning
9. **"What type of anesthesia will be used?"** — Anesthetic safety
10. **"What is the post-operative follow-up protocol?"** — Continuous support

### Signs of a Good Surgeon

- Answers your doubts clearly and patiently

## Conclusion

The choice between thread lifts and surgical facelift depends on individualized evaluation, considering sagging degree, patient expectations, and surgeon philosophy.

If you seek complete, lasting facial rejuvenation with natural results, surgical facelift, like Dr. Robério Brandão's Modern Face techniques, may be the best option.

For a subtle and quick lifting effect, thread lifts can be an interesting alternative.

Most important is to talk to a qualified and experienced professional to define the ideal treatment plan for you.
