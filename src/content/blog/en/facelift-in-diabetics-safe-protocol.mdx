# Facelift in Diabetics: The Essential Protocol for Safe Surgery

Facelift surgery, or rhytidectomy, is a procedure aimed at rejuvenating the face, attenuating wrinkles, sagging, and restoring younger contours. However, for patients with diabetes, this journey towards revitalization requires doubled care and a strict safety protocol. Diabetes, when uncontrolled, can significantly increase risks associated with any surgical procedure, including a facelift.

This article, prepared under supervision of Dr. Robério Brandão, specialist in facial surgery and creator of [Modern Face](/en/blog/modern-face-concept-philosophy) philosophy, details essential protocol to ensure safety and success of facelift in diabetic patients. We will cover from pre-operative evaluation and glycemic control, to post-operative care and most appropriate surgical techniques to minimize risks and optimize healing.

## Diabetes and Facial Surgery: A Delicate Combination

Diabetes mellitus is chronic disease characterized by elevated blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia). This hyperglycemia, when persistent, can lead to series of complications affecting various organs and body systems, including skin, blood vessels, and immune system.

For patients wishing to undergo facelift, uncontrolled diabetes can increase risk of:

*   **Poor healing:** Hyperglycemia hinders collagen production and formation of new blood vessels, essential for proper healing.
*   **Infection:** Diabetes compromises function of body's defense cells, making patient more susceptible to infections at surgery site.
*   **Clotting problems:** Diabetes can affect blood's ability to clot, increasing risk of bleeding and hematomas.
*   **Cardiovascular complications:** Diabetic patients have higher risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke, which can be triggered by surgery stress.

"Patient safety is always our number one priority. In diabetic patients, strict glycemic control is fundamental to minimize risks and ensure facelift success," states Dr. Robério Brandão.

## Pre-Operative Evaluation: Tracking Risks and Optimizing Health

Before any surgical decision, it is imperative to perform complete pre-operative evaluation, aiming to identify and control risk factors that can compromise diabetic patient safety. This evaluation should include:

*   **Detailed medical history:** Investigate type of diabetes, time of diagnosis, medications in use, previous glycemic control, and presence of other associated diseases.
*   **Complete physical exam:** Assess patient's general health status, with special attention to skin, blood vessels, and peripheral nerves.
*   **Laboratory exams:** Request complete blood count, fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), coagulogram, kidney function, electrolytes, and other exams deemed necessary.
*   **Cardiological evaluation:** In patients with history of cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors, cardiological evaluation may be necessary to determine surgery safety.
*   **Endocrinological evaluation:** It is fundamental that patient is being followed by endocrinologist, who will adjust medication and monitor glycemic control in pre and post-operative period.

A glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level below 7% is generally considered good indicator of glycemic control and important factor to minimize surgical risks.

## Pre-Operative Preparation: The Path to Glycemic Control

Pre-operative preparation is crucial stage to optimize glycemic control and reduce risks associated with facelift in diabetic patients. This preparation should include:

*   **Diet optimization:** Follow balanced diet, rich in fiber, fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins, with restriction of sugars and refined carbohydrates.
*   **Medication adjustment:** Endocrinologist will adjust dose of oral medications or insulin, according to blood glucose levels and patient needs.
*   **Strict glycemic monitoring:** Measure capillary blood glucose (with glucometer) several times a day, to ensure glucose levels remain within recommended therapeutic range.
*   **Suspension of medications:** Suspend use of medications that can increase bleeding risk, such as aspirin and anticoagulants, according to medical guidance.
*   **Smoking cessation:** Cigarettes harm healing and increase risk of complications. It is fundamental that patient stops smoking at least 30 days before surgery.
*   **Blood pressure control:** Maintaining controlled blood pressure is important to reduce risk of cardiovascular complications.

## Surgical Technique: Minimizing Trauma and Optimizing Healing

Surgical technique used in facelift in diabetic patients should be planned to minimize tissue trauma and optimize healing. Some important considerations include:

*   **Precise and smaller incisions:** Use precise and smaller incisions, following natural skin lines, to minimize risk of unsightly scars.
*   **Limited tissue dissection:** Avoid extensive dissections, which can compromise skin vascularization and increase risk of necrosis and infection.
*   **Strict hemostasis techniques:** Use strict hemostasis techniques, such as electrocautery and ligatures, to minimize risk of bleeding and hematomas.
*   **Delicate suture techniques:** Use delicate suture techniques, with high-quality threads, to approximate tissues without excessive tension.

"Choice of surgical technique should be individualized, taking into account characteristics of each patient and treatment goals. In diabetic patients, priority is always to minimize trauma and optimize healing," emphasizes Dr. Robério Brandão.

The Modern Face philosophy, prioritizing safety and optimized recovery, can be particularly beneficial for diabetic patients. Minimally invasive techniques, such as [Endomidface](/en/blog/endomidface-complete-guide), can be considered to reduce surgical trauma and accelerate recovery.

## Post-Operative Care: Monitoring Blood Sugar and Preventing Complications

Post-operative care is as important as surgery itself to ensure facelift success in diabetic patients. This care should include:

*   **Strict glycemic monitoring:** Measure capillary blood glucose several times a day and adjust medication dose, per endocrinologist's guidance, to keep glucose levels within recommended therapeutic range.
*   **Proper dressings:** Perform daily dressings with antiseptic solutions and healing ointments, following medical guidelines, to prevent infections and promote healing.
*   **Rest:** Avoid physical efforts and activities that can increase blood pressure and risk of bleeding.
*   **Nutrition:** Follow balanced diet, rich in proteins and vitamins, to provide necessary nutrients for healing.
*   **Hydration:** Keep well hydrated, drinking plenty of water and other healthy liquids.
*   **Medical follow-up:** Attend follow-up appointments, so surgeon can assess healing evolution and identify any complication early.

## Managing Complications: Agility and Expertise in Action

Even with all pre and post-operative care, some complications may occur, especially in diabetic patients. It is fundamental that surgeon is prepared to identify and treat them quickly and effectively. Most common complications include:

*   **Infection:** Start broad-spectrum antibiotics as soon as possible, besides performing wound cleaning and debridement, if necessary.
*   **Hematoma:** Drain hematoma surgically, if large or causing tissue compression.
*   **Skin necrosis:** Perform special dressings and, in some cases, skin grafts to repair affected area.
*   **Dehiscence (suture opening):** Perform new suture, with careful technique and high-quality threads, after controlling infection and optimizing healing.

## Choosing the Surgeon: Experience and Trust First

Choosing experienced and qualified plastic surgeon is fundamental for facelift success in diabetic patients. Look for professional who:

*   Has proven experience in facial surgery and diabetic patients.
*   Is member of Brazilian Society of Plastic Surgery (SBCP).
*   Works in team with trusted endocrinologist.
*   Has adequate hospital structure to perform surgery safely.
*   Conveys trust and safety to patient, explaining procedure, risks, and necessary care in detail.

"Surgeon's experience and quality of doctor-patient relationship are determining factors for facelift success in diabetic patients. Trust and open communication are fundamental for treatment success," emphasizes Dr. Robério Brandão.

## What to Expect: Recovery Timeline

Recovery is a journey requiring patience and specific care in each phase. Knowing what to expect helps reduce anxiety and optimize results.

### First 24-48 Hours

This is most delicate period. It is normal to present:

- **Moderate to intense edema**: swelling is maximum in this period
- **Bruising**: purple spots may appear and are natural part of healing
- **Controllable discomfort**: pain is generally mild to moderate, controlled with prescribed analgesics
- **Need for absolute rest**: avoid sudden movements and keep head elevated

### First Week (Days 3-7)

From third day, you will start noticing progressive improvements:

- Edema begins to decrease gradually
- Bruises change color (purple → green → yellow)
- Stitches and dressings can be removed as per medical guidance
- Light activities can be resumed with caution

### Weeks 2-4

Important transition phase:

- Gradual return to social and professional activities
- Residual edema still present, but less perceptible
- Result begins to define itself, although not yet definitive
- Lymphatic drainage massages may be indicated

### Months 1-3

Final result consolidates progressively:

- Tissues settle in definitive position
- Scars mature and become less visible
- Sensitivity gradually returns to normal
- Final result visible between 3-6 months

> "Patience is fundamental. Final result of facial procedure can only be evaluated after 6 months, when all tissues have stabilized." — Dr. Robério Brandão
