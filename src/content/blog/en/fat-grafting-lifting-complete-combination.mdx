# Facial Fat Grafting and [Facelift](/en/blog/facelift-complete-guide): Complete 3D Rejuvenation

The quest for facial rejuvenation that transcends mere wrinkle and sagging correction has led many patients and surgeons to explore approaches that restore lost volume and contour. The combination of **facial fat grafting**, also known as fat transfer, with **facelift** emerges as a powerful solution for complete three-dimensional rejuvenation.

This article, with the expertise of Dr. Robério Brandão, will explore in depth how this strategic combination can transform the face, restoring its lost vitality and harmony.

## What Is Facial Fat Grafting and Why Is It Important?

**Facial fat grafting** is a procedure that uses the patient's own fat to restore volume and contour in areas of the face that have lost these characteristics due to aging or other factors.

Over the years, it is natural for a decrease in fat volume to occur in certain facial regions, such as the cheeks, temples, and around the eyes. This volume loss contributes to a more aged appearance, with more evident grooves and shadows.

### How Does Facial Fat Grafting Work?

The procedure involves three main steps:

1.  **Liposuction:** Fat is gently removed from donor areas, such as the abdomen, thighs, or flanks, through small incisions.
2.  **Fat Processing:** Collected fat undergoes a purification and preparation process, removing impurities and optimizing it for grafting.
3.  **Fat Grafting:** Purified fat is injected in small amounts into recipient areas of the face, sculpting and restoring the desired volume.

### Face Areas That Can Be Treated With Fat Grafting

Facial fat grafting can be used to treat various areas of the face, including:

*   **Cheeks:** Restoration of volume and projection, providing a younger and more defined look.
*   **Nasolabial Folds (Smile Lines):** Softening of lines extending from the nose to the corner of the mouth.
*   **Temples:** Filling of areas that lose volume with age, smoothing tissues between face and hair.
*   **Dark Circles:** Attenuation of dark circles and improvement of contour around the eyes.
*   **Jawline:** Definition of the jawline, providing a more structured facial contour.
*   **Chin:** Chin augmentation and improvement of facial proportion.

### Is Fat Grafting a Permanent Procedure?

Although a part of the grafted fat is reabsorbed by the body in the first months after the procedure, the portion that remains integrated offers lasting results. The durability of fat grafting depends on factors such as the surgical technique used, individual patient characteristics, and lifestyle. In many cases, results can last for many years.

## Facelift: Correcting Sagging and Restoring Structure

**Facelift**, also known as rhytidectomy, is a surgical procedure aimed at repositioning facial tissues that have lost support and elasticity over time.

[Image: Illustration showing how facelift repositions facial tissues and removes excess skin]

### How Does a Facelift Work?

A facelift acts on different layers of the face, from skin to deeper structures, such as the Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System ([SMAS](/en/blog/smas-anatomy)). The procedure involves:

1.  **Incisions:** Incisions are generally made around the ears and hairline to minimize scar visibility.
2.  **Dissection:** Skin is gently lifted from underlying tissues, allowing access to deeper structures.
3.  **Repositioning:** SMAS and other structures are repositioned and tightened, restoring facial contour and correcting sagging.
4.  **Excess Skin Removal:** Excess skin is removed, and remaining skin is repositioned and sutured.

### Facelift Types

There are different facelift techniques, each with its particularities and indications. The main ones include:

*   **Classic Facelift:** More comprehensive approach, acting on all face layers and indicated for more severe sagging cases.
*   **Mini-Facelift:** Less invasive procedure, with smaller incisions and faster recovery, indicated for mild to moderate sagging cases.
*   **SMAS Facelift:** Technique acting specifically on the SMAS layer, providing more natural and lasting results.
*   **Neck Lift:** Focused on correcting neck sagging, with or without addressing cervical muscles and glands.

### Combination Advantages

*   **Volume Restoration:** Fat grafting fills areas that lost volume over time, such as cheeks and temples, restoring youthfulness and facial contour.
*   **Sagging Correction:** Facelift repositions facial tissues that lost support, correcting sagging and smoothing wrinkles and expression lines.
*   **Natural Results:** The combination of techniques provides more natural and harmonious results, avoiding the "stretched" look that can occur with isolated facelift.
*   **Three-Dimensional Rejuvenation:** By acting on both volume and structure of the face, the combination provides complete and balanced rejuvenation.
*   **Skin Quality Improvement:** Grafted fat contains stem cells and growth factors that can improve skin quality and texture.

### Dr. Robério Brandão's Modern Face Concept

Dr. Robério Brandão, renowned facial surgeon and creator of the Modern Face philosophy, emphasizes the importance of an individualized and three-dimensional approach in facial rejuvenation.

> "Modern Face seeks to restore the face's natural harmony and beauty, respecting each patient's individual characteristics. The combination of fat grafting and facelift is a powerful tool to achieve this goal, providing lasting and satisfactory results," says Dr. Robério Brandão.

Within the Modern Face concept, fat grafting is not just a "filler," but an essential component to restore facial structure and create a natural and lasting result.

## Facelift Techniques That Combine Well With Fat Grafting

Fat grafting can be combined with different facelift techniques, depending on each patient's needs and characteristics. Some of the most common combinations include:

*   **SMAS Facelift with Fat Grafting:** SMAS facelift acts on the muscular and aponeurotic layer of the face, providing longer-lasting results. Fat grafting complements the procedure, restoring lost volume and smoothing facial contour.
*   **Deep Plane Facelift with Fat Grafting:** Deep Plane Facelift is an advanced technique acting on a deeper plane of the face, allowing more comprehensive sagging correction. Fat grafting is used to restore volume in areas like cheeks and temples, providing a more complete result.
*   **Endolifting with Fat Grafting:** Endolifting is a minimally invasive technique using cannulas to reposition facial tissues. Fat grafting can be combined with endolifting to restore lost volume and improve facial contour.
*   **Mini-Facelift with Fat Grafting:** Mini-facelift is a less invasive option for patients with mild to moderate sagging. Fat grafting complements the procedure, restoring volume and providing a more natural result.
*   **Neck Lift with Fat Grafting:** In cases of neck sagging and facial volume loss, the combination of neck lift and fat grafting can provide complete and harmonious rejuvenation.

## Risks and Important Considerations

Like any surgical procedure, facial fat grafting and facelift present some risks, including:

*   **Infection:** Risk minimized with antibiotic use and aseptic techniques.
*   **Bleeding and Hematoma:** Controlled with careful surgical techniques and local compression.
*   **Fat Reabsorption:** Part of the grafted fat may be reabsorbed by the body, which may require touch-ups.
*   **Contour Irregularities:** Contour irregularities may occur in the grafted area, which can be corrected with touch-ups.
*   **Nerve Injuries:** Rare but possible risk of nerve injuries that can cause changes in sensitivity or muscle function.

It is fundamental to choose an experienced and qualified plastic surgeon who masters the techniques and can minimize risks.

> "Patient safety is always my priority. Therefore, I perform a detailed evaluation of each case and use minimally invasive surgical techniques to reduce risks and provide the best possible results," emphasizes Dr. Robério Brandão.

## Recovery and Results

Recovery time after facial fat grafting and facelift varies according to procedure extent and individual patient characteristics.

### Recovery

*   **Swelling and Bruising:** Common in the first days after surgery but decrease gradually.
*   **Rest:** Important to rest and avoid intense physical activities in the first weeks.
*   **Care:** Following medical guidelines, such as using cold compresses and prescribed medications, is fundamental for proper recovery.
*   **Return to Activities:** Most patients can return to normal activities in about 1 to 2 weeks, with some restrictions.

### Results

Results of combined facial fat grafting and facelift are visible soon after surgery but become more evident as swelling decreases and skin adapts to the new contour.

*   **Restored Volume:** Areas that lost volume gain a fuller and more youthful appearance.
*   **Corrected Sagging:** Skin is repositioned and sagging is attenuated, smoothing wrinkles and expression lines.
*   **Defined Facial Contour:** Jawline and other face areas gain definition and structure.
