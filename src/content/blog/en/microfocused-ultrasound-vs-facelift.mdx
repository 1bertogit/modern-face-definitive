## What is Microfocused Ultrasound?
Technologies like Ulthera, Ultraformer and other HIFU (High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound)
use ultrasound to create deep heating points, stimulating contraction and collagen
production.
## Who Is It Indicated For?
### Ultrasound - Good for:
- • Mild early laxity
- • Post-facelift maintenance
- • Those who don't want surgery
- • Early prevention
### Facelift - Necessary for:
- • Moderate to severe laxity
- • Real tissue ptosis
- • Excess skin
- • Significant result
## The Marketing Problem
Many clinics sell ultrasound as "facelift without surgery". This creates unrealistic
expectations. Ultrasound can slightly improve contour, but doesn't replace surgical
repositioning of ptosed tissues.
