faq:
  - question: "What are facial retaining ligaments?"
    answer: "They are fibrous structures that anchor the skin and soft tissues to bones and deep fasciae. They function as 'attachment points' that maintain the face in a youthful position. With aging, they weaken, allowing tissue ptosis."
  - question: "Why are ligaments important in facial surgery?"
    answer: "Ligaments determine aging patterns and are key points in surgical technique. Releasing them allows tissue mobilization; preserving them can provide anchorage. Their understanding is essential for natural and lasting results."
  - question: "What are the main facial ligaments?"
    answer: "The main ones are: zygomatic cutaneous ligament, mandibular ligament, orbital ligaments, parotid-masseteric ligaments, and the temporal fixation zone (conjunction zone). Each has a specific role in facial support."
  - question: "Does the zygomatic ligament cause the nasolabial fold?"
    answer: "Partially. The weakening of the zygomatic ligament allows malar ptosis, which 'falls' over the nasolabial fold, deepening it. But the fold itself is a normal anatomical structure, not created by the ligament."
  - question: "Are ligaments cut during surgery?"
    answer: "It depends on the technique. In Endomidface, ligaments like the zygomatic are released to allow malar elevation. In Deep Plane, mandibular ligaments are partially preserved. The decision is based on objectives."
  - question: "Do cut ligaments harm the result?"
    answer: "Not necessarily. Controlled ligament release allows tissue mobilization. Subsequent fixation in a new position creates new and durable anchors. It's the basis of modern rejuvenation techniques."
  - question: "What is McGregor's patch?"
    answer: "It's a zone of fibrous adherence over the zygomatic region, where the zygomatic cutaneous ligament is particularly dense. It's an important landmark in sub-SMAS dissection and in identifying the zygomatic ligament."
  - question: "How do ligaments affect jowl formation?"
    answer: "The jowl (pre-mandibular sag) forms where there's an absence of ligaments. The zone between the mandibular ligament (posterior) and the mental ligament (anterior) lacks ligamentous support, allowing accumulation of ptosed tissue."

## Why Do Ligaments Matter?
Imagine the face as a tent: the bones are the stakes, the skin is the canvas, and the
ligaments are the ropes that hold everything in place. When the ropes loosen, the tent
sags — creating bags, grooves, and sagging.
The **facial retaining ligaments** (also called retention ligaments or osteocutaneous
fixation points) are fibrous structures that anchor the skin and SMAS to bones and deep fasciae.
With aging, they weaken, allowing the characteristic ptosis of facial aging.

## How Ligaments Explain Aging
Facial aging is not uniform — it follows patterns determined by ligaments:
#### Nasolabial Fold
The zygomatic ligament fixes malar fat. When it weakens, the fat descends, creating
the "fold" over the nasolabial groove, deepening it.
#### Jowl (Mandibular Sag)
The jowl forms in the "window" between ligaments: anterior to the mandibular
ligament, where there's no support. Ptosed tissues accumulate in this area of least
resistance.
#### Festoons and Malar Mounds
The weakening of orbital ligaments allows fluid and tissue accumulation in the
palpebromalar region, creating characteristic "bags".
#### Brow Tail Ptosis
The temporal fixation zone weakens, allowing the lateral portion of the brow to
fall. Contributes to tired appearance.

## Surgical Implications
Knowledge of ligaments guides surgical strategy:
### Ligament Release
Allows tissue mobilization for repositioning in a younger position. Essential for
lasting results.
- • Endomidface: releases zygomatic
- • Deep Plane: releases masseteric, preserves mandibular
- • Browlift: releases temporal zone
### Ligament Preservation
Maintains natural anchor points. Can be strategic in some techniques to maintain
contours.
- • Partial mandibular preservation
- • Maintenance of orbital ligaments
- • Anchorage in preserved ligaments
#### ⚠️ Point of Attention
Release of the zygomatic ligament exposes the zygomatic branch of the facial nerve.
Detailed anatomical knowledge is essential for safe dissection in this region.
