## Where Is the Scar?
The facelift scar is strategically positioned in hidden areas: starts in the scalp (above
the ear), descends contouring the ear in front of the tragus, contours the lobe and rises
behind the ear, ending in the posterior hair.
### Incision Locations:
Our [Endomidface technique often allows for more limited incisions, focusing on natural creases for maximum camouflage.
- • **Temporal:** Within the scalp
- • **Pre-auricular:** In the anterior fold of the ear
- • **Intra-tragal:** Inside the tragus (more aesthetic variation)
- • **Retro-auricular:** In the groove behind the ear
- • **Occipital:** In the posterior hair
## Scar Evolution
**1-2 weeks:**
Pink scar, sutures present
**1-3 months:**
Maturation phase, may become temporarily redder
**3-6 months:**
Progressive lightening
**6-12 months:**
Mature scar, virtually imperceptible
## Care for Better Scarring
- • Rigorous sun protection for 6-12 months
- • Do not smoke (compromises healing)
- • Adequate scar hydration
- • Use of silicone if indicated
- • Avoid trauma to the region
- • Follow surgeon's guidelines
