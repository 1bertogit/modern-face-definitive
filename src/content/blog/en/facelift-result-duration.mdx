## Is a Facelift Permanent?
A facelift doesn't stop aging — it **resets the clock**. You'll continue
aging, but from a more youthful starting point. Patients who had a facelift at 55 will
look better at 65 than they would have without surgery.
## Duration by Technique
### Skin-Only Facelift
3-5 years of visible benefit
### SMASectomy/SMAS Plication
5-8 years of visible benefit
### Deep Techniques ([Endomidface, Deep Plane)
**8-12+ years** of visible benefit
## Influencing Factors
- • **Genetics** — natural aging speed
- • **Sun exposure** — photoaging accelerates aging
- • **Smoking** — compromises tissues
- • **Skin quality** — preserved elasticity
- • **Technique used** — depth of correction
- • **Postoperative care** — proper maintenance
