faq:
  - question: "Can I have a facelift if I've had Sculptra?"
    answer: "Yes, but the surgeon must be prepared to encounter modified tissue. Sculptra (poly-L-lactic acid) creates neocollagenesis and can form nodules or fibrosis. The Modern Face technique was specifically developed for these patients, using planes less affected by biostimulators."
  - question: "How long should I wait between biostimulator and surgery?"
    answer: "There's no absolute consensus, but it's recommended to wait at least 6-12 months after the last biostimulator application. This allows tissue stabilization and better evaluation of the biostimulator result. For hyaluronic acid fillers, the time can be shorter (3-6 months)."
  - question: "Do biostimulators increase surgical complication risks?"
    answer: "They can increase technical difficulty, but not necessarily complications if the surgeon is prepared. Risks include: more difficult dissection due to fibrosis, altered anatomical planes, and possibility of encountering granulomas. Proper technique (like subperiosteal Endomidface) minimizes these risks."
  - question: "Can the surgeon remove biostimulator during the lift?"
    answer: "It depends on the type. Hyaluronic acid can be dissolved with hyaluronidase before or during surgery. Particulate biostimulators (Sculptra, Radiesse, Ellansé) cannot be easily 'removed' — granulomas can be excised, but diffuse product remains."
  - question: "Which lifting technique is best for those who've had biostimulators?"
    answer: "The Direct Vision Endomidface technique is particularly suitable because it works in the subperiosteal plane — a plane rarely affected by biostimulators, which remain more superficial. Traditional Deep Plane (sub-SMAS) can be more challenging in these patients."
  - question: "Should I inform the surgeon about all fillers I've had?"
    answer: "Absolutely yes. Provide complete history: product type, approximate amount, dates, application sites. This allows proper planning and avoids intraoperative surprises. Photos before procedures help with evaluation."
  - question: "Can I have biostimulator after the lift?"
    answer: "Generally yes, after complete healing (3-6 months). Biostimulators can complement surgical results in specific areas. However, some surgeons prefer to avoid particulate biostimulators in operated areas. Discuss with your surgeon."
  - question: "Is fibrosis from biostimulator permanent?"
    answer: "Fibrosis tends to be permanent to varying degrees. However, it can soften over time and the surgical process (dissection) itself can release some adhesions. Proper planning allows working around or through fibrosis safely."

## The Silent Change in Facial Surgery
There's a reality that few plastic surgery textbooks address: **most patients who come to the office seeking surgical rejuvenation have already
received injectable treatments**. Fillers, biostimulators, support threads — years of treatments that have
fundamentally modified facial anatomy.
This isn't a problem when you're doing more filling. But when the scalpel enters,
everything changes. Anatomical planes that should glide easily are adherent. Tissues
that should have predictable consistency have areas of irregular fibrosis. Landmarks you
memorized may be displaced.
The [Modern Face® was born from this reality. It's a surgical philosophy developed for the contemporary patient
— one whose facial tissue has history.

## What Do Biostimulators Do to Tissue?
To understand the surgical impact, we need to understand the mechanism of action of
biostimulators:
### Basic Mechanism

1
**Injection:** Particles are deposited in subcutaneous or subdermal tissue

2
**Inflammatory reaction:** The body recognizes particles as foreign body

3
**Encapsulation:** Fibroblasts deposit collagen around particles

4
**Neocollagenesis:** Continuous collagen production creates sustained volume

This process is desirable for non-surgical rejuvenation. But surgically, it means:
#### Fibrosis
Scar tissue that adheres anatomical planes. The sub-SMAS that should glide easily
may be "welded".
#### Granulomas
Inflammatory nodules around particles. Can be confused with anatomical structures or
tumors.
#### Altered Planes
Neocollagenesis can create "false planes" that seem correct but lead to dangerous
structures.
#### Irregular Consistency
Areas of normal tissue interspersed with fibrosis areas make uniform dissection
difficult.

## Technical Adaptations for the Modern Face
The Modern Face philosophy incorporates several adaptations to deal with tissue modified
by injectables:
### 1. Preference for Subperiosteal Plane
The subperiosteal plane (between periosteum and bone) is rarely affected by
biostimulators, which remain more superficial. The Direct Vision Endomidface technique works in this plane, offering predictable dissection even in treated faces.
### 2. Direct Vision over Endoscopy
Direct vision allows identifying and bypassing areas of fibrosis in real time.
Traditional endoscopy may have difficulty distinguishing correct plane from pseudoplane
created by fibrosis.
### 3. Careful and Deliberate Dissection
Instead of rapid, aggressive dissection, Modern Face advocates deliberate dissection
with constant structure identification. This is especially important when landmarks may
be displaced.
### 4. Detailed Preoperative Evaluation
Complete history of injectables, palpation of fibrosis/nodule areas, and in selected
cases, ultrasound to map biostimulator deposits.
#### 💡 Modern Face Preoperative Protocol
- • List ALL injectables: type, amount, date, location
- • Request pre-procedure photos (when available)
- • Systematic palpation seeking nodules/fibrosis
- • Consider preoperative HA dissolution
- • Wait adequate time post-biostimulator
- • Plan adapted technique (subperiosteal preference)

## Frequently Asked Questions

## Conclusion: Adapting to the New Reality
The Modern Face patient isn't the exception — it's the rule. Surgeons who insist on
techniques developed for virgin tissue will encounter increasing difficulties.
Adaptation isn't optional; it's a requirement for consistent and safe results.
The Modern Face Institute programs were specifically developed for this reality, teaching techniques that work on
both virgin tissue and treated faces.
