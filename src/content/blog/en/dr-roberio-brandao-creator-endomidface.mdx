In a field where techniques are often guarded as secrets,
**Dr. Robério Brandão** chose a different path. After developing **Direct Vision Endomidface**, a technique that solves limitations of traditional approaches, he decided to
systematize it and teach it to other surgeons.

## The Journey to Modern Face
Dr. Robério's journey didn't begin with the intention of creating a new technique. It
began with a frustration: available techniques didn't meet the needs of patients arriving
at the office.


## Why "Father of Modern Face"?
The term **"Modern Face"** is not just a commercial name. It's the recognition
that faces arriving for surgery today are fundamentally different from faces of 20 years ago.
### What makes a face "modern"?
- • **Exposure to biostimulators** — 90% have used some type
- • **Previous treatments** — botulinum toxin, fillers, threads
- • **Tissue fibrosis** — altered anatomical planes
- • **Different expectations** — naturalness, quick recovery
Dr. Robério recognized that trying to apply techniques developed for "virgin" faces to
modern faces was inadequate — and potentially dangerous. Modern Face® was born as a
response to this new reality.

## The Philosophy Behind the Technique
More than a surgical technique, Modern Face® is a philosophy based on three non-negotiable
pillars:
🛡️
### Maximum Safety
No aesthetic result justifies compromising patient safety.
✨
### Elegance in Results
Natural rejuvenation that respects individual patient anatomy.
⚡
### Optimized Recovery
Techniques that minimize trauma and allow quick return to activities.

## The Decision to Teach: Revolution in Facial Surgery
What differentiates Dr. Robério from many surgeons who develop their own techniques is his
conscious decision to **democratize knowledge**. Instead of keeping the
technique as a competitive advantage, he chose to format structured teaching programs.
> "A technique is only good if it can be taught. A technique is excellent when students
> achieve consistent results."
> 
> - — Dr. Robério Brandão
Today, through the Modern Face Institute, surgeons from all over Brazil have access to
structured training in Modern Face® techniques, with direct mentorship from the creator.
