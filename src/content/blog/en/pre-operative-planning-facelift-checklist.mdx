# Essential Checklist: Pre-Operative Planning for a Safe [Facelift](/en/blog/facelift-complete-guide)

A facelift is a transformative procedure that can rejuvenate your appearance and restore facial harmony. However, the success of a facelift does not depend only on the surgeon's skill during surgery. Meticulous pre-operative planning is fundamental to optimize results, minimize risks, and ensure a positive experience.

This article offers a complete checklist to help you prepare properly for your facelift. We will cover everything from the initial consultation and necessary exams to skin care and precautions to be taken before the procedure.

## 1. Detailed Initial Consultation: The First Step to Success

The initial consultation is the foundation of the entire process. It is the moment to establish open and honest communication with the surgeon, discuss your expectations, and understand the possibilities and limitations of the procedure.

### 1.1. Choosing the Ideal Plastic Surgeon
- **Verify credentials:** Ensure the surgeon is a member of the Brazilian Society of Plastic Surgery (SBCP) or other renowned international associations (ASPS, ISAPS).
- **Evaluate experience:** Look for a surgeon with vast experience in facelifts and a portfolio of consistent and natural results.
- **Trust and empathy:** Choose a surgeon you feel comfortable discussing your concerns with and who demonstrates genuine interest in your needs.

### 1.2. Exposing your Expectations and Goals
- **Communicate clearly:** Explain in detail what you hope to achieve with the facelift.
- **Be realistic:** Understand that a facelift can improve appearance but cannot stop the aging process or transform you into another person.
- **Photos as reference:** Bring photos from when you were younger to show the surgeon the result you wish to achieve.

### 1.3. Evaluation of Your Facial Anatomy
- **Skin analysis:** The surgeon will evaluate your skin's elasticity, texture, and quality to determine the most suitable technique.
- **Bone structure:** Analysis of your facial bone structure will help define the surgical plan and predict results.
- **Fat presence:** Facial fat distribution will be evaluated to determine the need for fat grafting or other complementary techniques.

### 1.4. Complete Medical and Medication History
- **Inform everything:** Be transparent about your medical history, including pre-existing diseases, allergies, and previous surgeries.
- **Medications:** List all medications you use, including vitamins, supplements, and herbal remedies.
- **Habits:** Inform about your smoking habits, alcohol consumption, and drug use.

### 1.5. Detailed Physical Examination
- **Blood pressure:** Verification of blood pressure to identify possible cardiovascular risks.
- **Thyroid evaluation:** Thyroid examination to rule out problems that may affect healing.
- **Neurological exam:** Evaluation of facial nerves to identify possible pre-existing dysfunctions.

## 2. Indispensable Exams: Ensuring Procedure Safety

After the initial consultation, the surgeon will request a series of exams to assess your general health and identify possible contraindications for the facelift.

### 2.1. Blood Tests
- **Complete blood count:** Evaluates blood cells and detects anemias or infections.
- **Coagulogram:** Evaluates blood clotting capacity, essential to prevent excessive bleeding.
- **Glycemia:** Measures blood sugar levels, important for diabetic patients.
- **Kidney and liver function:** Evaluates kidney and liver function, organs responsible for metabolizing medications.

### 2.2. Cardiological Evaluation
- **Electrocardiogram (ECG):** Evaluates heart's electrical activity, identifying possible arrhythmias or other changes.
- **Surgical risk:** In some cases, an opinion from a cardiologist may be necessary to assess surgical risk.

### 2.3. Imaging Exams (Optional)
- **Facial ultrasound:** Allows evaluating muscle structure and presence of fibrosis resulting from previous aesthetic procedures, such as biostimulator application.
- **CT scan:** In specific cases, may be requested to assess facial bone structure.

## 3. Essential Skin Care: Preparing the Ground for Surgery

The quality of your skin plays a fundamental role in the facelift result. Adopting a skin care routine before surgery can optimize healing and improve final appearance.

### 3.1. Avoid Excessive Sun Exposure
- **Daily sun protection:** Use sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher daily, even on cloudy days.
- **Avoid tanning:** Do not expose yourself to sun or tanning beds for at least 4 weeks before surgery.

### 3.2. Adequate Hydration
- **Drink water:** Keep hydrated by drinking at least 2 liters of water per day.
- **Moisturizers:** Use moisturizers recommended by your surgeon to keep skin soft and flexible.

### 3.3. Specific Products
- **Retinoids:** In some cases, the surgeon may recommend using retinoids to improve skin quality.
- **Hyaluronic acid:** Using products with hyaluronic acid can help hydrate skin and improve healing.

## 4. Discontinuation of Medications and Supplements: Minimizing Bleeding Risks

Some medications and supplements can increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgery. It is crucial to inform your surgeon about all products you use and follow their guidelines on discontinuing use.

### 4.1. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Agents
- **AAS (Aspirin):** Stop use at least 14 days before surgery.
- **Warfarin:** Adjust dose or replace with another anticoagulant under medical supervision.
- **Clopidogrel (Plavix):** Stop use at least 7 days before surgery.

### 4.2. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)
- **Ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac:** Stop use at least 7 days before surgery.

### 4.3. Supplements and Herbal Remedies
- **Ginkgo biloba, ginseng, garlic, vitamin E:** Stop use at least 14 days before surgery.

## 5. Quit Smoking: Essential for Successful Healing

Smoking is one of healing's biggest enemies. Nicotine and other substances present in cigarettes compromise blood circulation, increasing risk of complications such as skin necrosis and hypertrophic scars.

### 5.1. Total Smoking Cessation
- **30 days before:** Stop smoking at least 30 days before surgery.
- **After surgery:** Stay away from cigarettes for at least 30 days after procedure to ensure proper healing.

### 5.2. Alternatives to Deal with Withdrawal
- **Nicotine patches:** Consult your doctor about using nicotine patches or gums to control withdrawal.
- **Psychological support:** Seek psychological support to deal with anxiety and stress related to smoking cessation.

- **Vitamins and minerals:** Include fruits, vegetables, and greens in your diet to ensure adequate intake of essential vitamins and minerals.
- **Anti-inflammatory foods:** Prioritize foods with anti-inflammatory properties, such as fish rich in omega-3, red fruits, and olive oil.

### 6.2. Avoid Processed Foods
- **Ultra-processed:** Reduce or avoid consumption of processed foods, rich in sugar, saturated fats, and sodium, which can harm healing.

### 6.3. Constant Hydration
- **Water:** Drink at least 2 liters of water per day to keep skin hydrated and facilitate toxin elimination.

## 7. Expectation Alignment: Visualizing Desired Result

It is crucial to have realistic expectations about facelift results. The procedure can significantly improve your appearance but cannot perform miracles.

### 7.1. Open Discussion with Surgeon
- **Expectations:** Communicate your expectations and listen attentively to surgeon's explanations about what is achievable with facelift.
- **Photos:** Analyze before and after photos of other patients to have a realistic idea of results.
- **Limitations:** Understand procedure limitations and be prepared for possible touch-ups or complementary procedures.

### 7.2. Result Visualization
- **Simulation software:** Use 3D simulation software to visualize facelift result on your own face.
- **Mirror:** Observe yourself in mirror and identify areas that bother you most and that you would like to improve.

## What to Expect: Recovery Timeline

Recovery is a journey requiring patience and specific care in each phase. Knowing what to expect helps reduce anxiety and optimize results.

### First 24-48 Hours

This is the most delicate period. It is normal to present:

- **Moderate to intense edema**: swelling is maximum in this period
- **Ecchymosis**: purple spots may appear and are natural part of healing
- **Controllable discomfort**: pain is generally mild to moderate, controlled with prescribed painkillers
- **Need for absolute rest**: avoid sudden movements and keep head elevated

### First Week (Days 3-7)

From third day, you will start noticing progressive improvements:

- Edema begins to decrease gradually
- Ecchymosis change color (purple → green → yellow)
- Stitches and dressings may be removed as per medical guidance
- Light activities can be resumed with caution

### Weeks 2-4

Important transition phase:

- Gradual return to social and professional activities
- Residual edema still present, but less noticeable
- Result begins to define, although not yet definitive
- Lymphatic drainage massages may be indicated

### Months 1-3

Final result consolidates progressively:

- Tissues settle into their definitive position
- Scars mature and become less visible
- Sensitivity returns gradually to normal
- Final result visible between 3-6 months
