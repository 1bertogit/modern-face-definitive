This complete guide, with insights from Dr. Robério Brandão, creator of the Modern Face philosophy, will help you understand differences, indications, and results of each procedure.

## What is a Facelift and How Does it Rejuvenate?

A facelift, also known as rhytidectomy, is a surgical procedure aiming to rejuvenate the face by repositioning underlying facial tissues, smoothing wrinkles, and removing excess skin.

### Facelift Mechanisms of Action

A facelift acts on different layers of the face to provide complete rejuvenation:

*   **SMAS Repositioning:** The Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System (SMAS) is a layer of tissue supporting skin and facial muscles. A facelift repositions the SMAS, restoring youthful facial contour.
*   **Excess Skin Removal:** Removal of loose excess skin contributes to a firmer and more defined result.
*   **Wrinkle Smoothing:** By repositioning tissues and removing excess skin, a facelift smooths wrinkles and expression lines.

### Types of Facelift

There are different types of facelifts, each with its particularities:

*   **Classic Facelift:** More comprehensive approach, treating face, neck, and jawline region.
*   **Mini Facelift:** Less invasive procedure, with smaller incisions and faster recovery, ideal for mild to moderate sagging cases.
*   **Midface Lift (Endomidface):** Focused on cheekbones and nasolabial fold region. The [Endomidface](/en/blog/endomidface-complete-guide) technique, created by Dr. Robério Brandão, provides natural and long-lasting results.
*   **Neck Lift (Deep Neck):** Concentrated on neck region, treating sagging, double chin, and excess fat. The [Deep Neck](/en/blog/deep-neck-complete-guide), as performed by Dr. Robério, seeks a defined contour without removing the submandibular gland.

### Modern Face Philosophy and Facelift

In Dr. Robério Brandão's [Modern Face](/en/blog/modern-face-concept-philosophy) philosophy, a facelift is more than a surgical procedure; it is an art seeking harmony and naturalness. The philosophy prioritizes:

*   **Natural Results:** Avoiding artificial and "stretched" look is fundamental.
*   **Minimal Invasiveness:** Minimally invasive techniques, like Endomidface, are prioritized to reduce recovery time and risks.
*   **Long-Lasting Results:** Repositioning underlying facial tissues ensures a longer-lasting result than simply "pulling" the skin.

### Ideal Candidates for Facelift

A facelift is indicated for people presenting:

*   Skin sagging on face and neck
*   Facial volume loss
*   Deep wrinkles and expression lines
*   Platysmal bands (neck cords)

It is important to emphasize that a facelift does not prevent aging, but rejuvenates the face, providing a younger and well-rested appearance.

## What are Facial Fillers and How Do They Rejuvenate?

Facial fillers are non-surgical aesthetic procedures using injectable substances to restore lost facial volume, smooth wrinkles, and improve face contour.

### Facial Fillers Mechanisms of Action

Facial fillers act in various ways to rejuvenate the face:

*   **Volume Replacement:** Fill areas that lost volume with aging, like cheekbones, temples, and chin.
*   **Wrinkle Smoothing:** Fill wrinkles and expression lines, like nasolabial folds (smile lines) and marionette lines.
*   **Contour Improvement:** Define facial contour, enhancing cheekbones, jawline, and lips.
*   **Collagen Stimulation:** Some fillers, like poly-L-lactic acid (Sculptra), stimulate collagen production, improving skin quality long-term.

### Types of Facial Fillers

There are various types of facial fillers available, each with its characteristics and indications:

*   **Hyaluronic Acid:** Most widely used filler, being biocompatible and reversible. Offers natural results and can be used in various face areas.
*   **Calcium Hydroxyapatite:** Stimulates collagen production, providing a lifting effect and improving skin quality.
*   **Poly-L-Lactic Acid (Sculptra):** Stimulates collagen production, providing a gradual and long-lasting rejuvenation effect.
*   **Autologous Fat (Fat Grafting):** Uses patient's own fat to fill face areas. It is a more invasive procedure, but offers natural and long-lasting results.

### Ideal Candidates for Facial Fillers

Facial fillers are indicated for people who wish to:

*   Restore lost facial volume
*   Smooth wrinkles and expression lines
*   Improve facial contour
*   Rejuvenate face non-surgically

It is important to emphasize that facial fillers do not treat skin sagging, being more indicated for volume loss and wrinkle cases.

## Facelift vs Fillers: Which is the Best Option for You?

Choosing between facelift and fillers depends on various factors, such as:

*   **Degree of skin sagging:** If sagging is mild to moderate, fillers may be sufficient. If severe, facelift is more indicated.
*   **Facial volume:** If goal is restoring lost volume, fillers are best option.
*   **Type of wrinkles:** Fillers are effective for fine and superficial wrinkles. For deep wrinkles, facelift may be more suitable.
*   **Duration of results:** Facelift offers longer-lasting results, while fillers need to be reapplied periodically.
*   **Recovery time:** Facelift recovery is longer than fillers.
*   **Costs:** Facelift generally has higher cost than fillers.

## What to Expect: Recovery Timeline

Recovery is a journey requiring patience and specific care in each phase. Knowing what to expect helps reduce anxiety and optimize results.

### First 24-48 Hours

This is most delicate period. It is normal to present:

- **Moderate to intense edema**: swelling is maximum in this period
- **Bruising**: purple spots may appear and are natural part of healing
- **Controllable discomfort**: pain is generally mild to moderate, controlled with prescribed analgesics
- **Need for absolute rest**: avoid sudden movements and keep head elevated

### First Week (Days 3-7)

From third day, you will start noticing progressive improvements:

- Edema begins to decrease gradually
- Bruises change color (purple → green → yellow)
- Stitches and dressings can be removed as per medical guidance
- Light activities can be resumed with caution

### Weeks 2-4

Important transition phase:

- Gradual return to social and professional activities
- Residual edema still present, but less perceptible
- Result begins to define itself, although not yet definitive
- Lymphatic drainage massages may be indicated

### Months 1-3

Final result consolidates progressively:

- Tissues settle in definitive position
- Scars mature and become less visible
- Sensitivity gradually returns to normal
- Final result visible between 3-6 months

> "Patience is fundamental. Final result of facial procedure can only be evaluated after 6 months, when all tissues have stabilized." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## Conclusion

Choice between facelift and fillers is personal decision that should be made together with experienced plastic surgeon. If you seek long-lasting rejuvenation with natural results, facelift may be best option. If you wish to restore facial volume and smooth wrinkles non-surgically, fillers may be right choice.

Remember that Modern Face prioritizes individuality of each patient, seeking ideal treatment to achieve your aesthetic goals with safety and naturalness.
