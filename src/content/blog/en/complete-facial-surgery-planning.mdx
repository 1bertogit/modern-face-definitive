faq:
  - question: "What is the ideal sequence of procedures in facial surgery?"
    answer: "Typical sequence is: 1) Browlift (if indicated), 2) Blepharoplasty, 3) Endomidface/midface, 4) Lower third facelift, 5) Deep Neck/neck. May vary by surgeon preference, but generally follows superior to inferior direction."
  - question: "Should all procedures be done at the same time?"
    answer: "Not necessarily. Combined procedures save total recovery time but increase surgical duration. In older patients or those with comorbidities, it may be prudent to stage procedures. Decision is individualized."
  - question: "How to decide which procedures the patient needs?"
    answer: "Systematic assessment by thirds: upper, middle, lower and neck. Each area is evaluated independently. Final plan considers identified needs, patient desires, general health and logistics."
  - question: "Are photos important in planning?"
    answer: "Essential. Standardized photos (5 angles minimum) allow detailed analysis, surgical planning, patient communication and documentation. Patient's old photos also help define realistic goals."
  - question: "How to align expectations with patient?"
    answer: "Frank discussion about what's achievable. Use old photos as reference for 'best you'. Show similar cases (with permission). Be clear about limitations. Document everything in writing."
  - question: "What if patient wants procedures that aren't indicated?"
    answer: "Education is key. Explain why it's not indicated. If they insist on something harmful, refuse. Better to lose a patient than perform inadequate procedure. Your reputation depends on good results."

## Planning: The Foundation of Success
Facial surgery is not a single procedure — it's often a combination of techniques
adapted to individual needs. Meticulous planning determines which procedures are
necessary, in what sequence, and what's realistic to achieve.

## Systematic Assessment by Thirds
The face should be evaluated systematically, region by region:
What to evaluate:
Possible procedures:

## Typical Surgical Sequence
When multiple procedures are performed, sequence matters:
1
#### Browlift / Frontoplasty
If indicated, start from top. Elevates eyebrow and defines how much excess skin
actually exists in upper eyelid.
2
#### Blepharoplasty
Upper and/or lower. After browlift (if done), to avoid removing excess skin. Can
be combined with canthopexy.
3
#### Endomidface / Midface Lift
Midface elevation. In Endomidface, can be done via temporal or transoral incision.
4
#### Lower Third Facelift
SMAS approach, jowl and mandibular contour. Via traditional pre/retro-auricular
incision.
5
#### Deep Neck / Cervicoplasty
Neck treatment: Platysmaplasty, digastric shaving, glandular sling, liposuction if
indicated.

## Preoperative Protocol
### Essential Documentation
- ✓ Standardized photos (5 angles minimum)
- ✓ Assessment form (SPE-M or similar)
- ✓ Detailed informed consent
- ✓ Written surgical plan
- ✓ Preoperative tests
- ✓ Cardiac evaluation if indicated
### Patient Guidelines
- ✓ Stop smoking 4-6 weeks
- ✓ Stop aspirin/NSAIDs 7-10 days
- ✓ List of allowed/prohibited medications
- ✓ Preoperative fasting
- ✓ Mandatory companion
- ✓ Written postoperative instructions

## Expectation Alignment
Patient satisfaction depends as much on results as on expectations. Unrealistic
expectations lead to dissatisfaction even with excellent results.
#### Use old photos
Patient's photos from 10-15 years ago show the "best them" as realistic goal, not an
impossible ideal.
#### Show limitations
What facelift does NOT correct: spots, pores, fine wrinkles, bony asymmetries. Be
clear.
#### Document everything
Surgical plan, discussed expectations, explained limitations — all in writing.
Protects you and the patient.
