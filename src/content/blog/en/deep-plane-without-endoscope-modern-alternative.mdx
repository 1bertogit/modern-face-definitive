## What is Endoscope-Free Deep Plane?

The Endoscope-Free Deep Plane is an advanced facelift technique aiming to reposition deep facial layers, including the Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System (SMAS). Unlike traditional facelifts, which focus primarily on the skin, the Deep Plane acts on the face's structural base, providing more natural and long-lasting results.

The absence of an endoscope, an optical instrument used for internal visualization, does not mean the technique is less precise. On the contrary, it requires deep knowledge of facial anatomy and refined surgical skills, allowing the surgeon to perform the procedure with precision and safety, guided by experience and touch.

### The Modern Face Philosophy

The Endoscope-Free Deep Plane technique aligns with the **Modern Face** philosophy, a concept developed by Dr. Robério Brandão seeking:

*   **Natural Results:** Prioritizing rejuvenation that respects individuality and facial harmony.
*   **Optimized Recovery:** Minimizing recovery time and post-operative discomfort.
*   **Non-Negotiable Safety:** Using techniques that maximally reduce surgical risks.
*   **Accessibility:** Democratizing access to advanced procedures, making them less dependent on expensive equipment.

## How Does Endoscope-Free Deep Plane Work?

The Endoscope-Free Deep Plane procedure involves the following steps:

1.  **Incision:** Strategic incisions are made, generally smaller and more discreet than traditional facelifts.
2.  **Dissection:** The surgeon performs careful dissection of skin and subcutaneous tissue, preserving important blood vessels and nerves.
3.  **SMAS Release:** The SMAS is released from underlying structures, allowing it to be repositioned.
4.  **Repositioning:** SMAS and other deep facial layers are repositioned to a younger and more natural position.
5.  **Excess Skin Removal:** Excess skin is removed, and incisions are closed with delicate sutures.

## Relevant Anatomy for This Procedure

Anatomical knowledge is fundamental to understanding how results are achieved safely and effectively.

### Key Structures

The face is composed of layers that must be understood together:

- **Skin**: the most superficial layer, reflecting aging through wrinkles and sagging
- **Subcutaneous tissue**: contains fat that redistributes with age
- **SMAS (Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System)**: fundamental layer connecting muscles to skin
- **Facial muscles**: responsible for expression and dynamic support
- **Retaining ligaments**: anchor skin to the facial skeleton
- **Facial nerves**: control movement and sensitivity

### Surgical Planes

In the Modern Face philosophy, we work on specific planes:

- **Superficial plane**: above SMAS, used in less invasive procedures
- **Deep plane (sub-SMAS)**: below SMAS, allows more lasting results
- **Subcutaneous plane**: used for fat grafting and fat treatment

### Why It Matters

Understanding anatomy explains:

- Why certain procedures last longer than others
- How natural results are achieved
- Why surgeon experience is crucial
- How complications can be avoided

> "Respect for anatomy is what separates a natural result from an unnatural one. In Modern Face, every structure has its role and must be preserved or repositioned with precision." — Dr. Robério Brandão

### First Week: Intermediate Care

As healing advances:

- **Careful hygiene**: clean area as directed, without rubbing
- **Avoid sun exposure**: use hat and sunscreen when necessary to go out
- **Gentle facial movements**: avoid exaggerated expressions
- **Adequate sleep**: body recovers mainly during sleep
- **Avoid alcohol and tobacco**: both impair healing

### Weeks 2-4: Gradual Return

Return to activities should be progressive:

- **Light activities**: short walks are allowed
- **Remote work**: can be resumed as comfortable
- **Light makeup**: generally allowed after 2 weeks
- **Moderate exercise**: only with medical clearance
- **Lymphatic drainage**: indicated to accelerate recovery

### What to Avoid

Throughout recovery period:

- Direct sun exposure on operated areas
- Intense physical activities before clearance
- Alcohol consumption in first 2 weeks
- Smoking (ideally stop 4 weeks before and after)
- Non-prescribed anti-inflammatories
- Sudden movements with face
