faq:
  - question: "How far in advance should I start preparing?"
    answer: "Ideally start 4-6 weeks before, especially if you smoke (need to stop) or use medications affecting coagulation. Exams can be done 2-4 weeks before. Logistical organization should be ready 1 week before."
  - question: "Do I need to do all listed exams?"
    answer: "Depends on your age and health. Young healthy patients may need only basic exams. Patients with comorbidities or &gt;50 years generally need more complete evaluation. Your surgeon will define what's necessary."
  - question: "Why do I need to stop smoking?"
    answer: "Smoking severely compromises skin microcirculation. This dramatically increases risk of skin necrosis, poor healing and complications. It's not exaggeration — it's safety requirement. Minimum 4 weeks without smoking."
  - question: "Can I continue my blood pressure medications?"
    answer: "Generally yes, and it's important to keep BP controlled. Discuss specifically with your surgeon and anesthesiologist. Some medications may need adjustment. NEVER suspend BP medication without guidance."
  - question: "Do I need companion even with local anesthesia?"
    answer: "Yes, mandatory. Even with light sedation, you cannot drive or be alone in first 24h. Companion must be present at discharge and stay with you. This is not optional."
  - question: "What should I have at home for recovery?"
    answer: "Prescribed medications, prepared light food, ice, extra pillows (sleep elevated), comfortable front-opening clothes, and quiet environment. Avoid unnecessary stairs in first days."

## Critical Points
#### 🚭 Smoking
Non-negotiable. Tobacco compromises microcirculation and dramatically increases
necrosis risk. Minimum 4 weeks without smoking — including e-cigarettes and hookah.
#### 💊 Medications
Inform EVERYTHING you take — including supplements and herbal medicines. Some affect
coagulation without you knowing. Never hide medications from your surgeon.
#### 👥 Companion
Mandatory. Must be present at discharge, take you home and stay with you first 24h.
