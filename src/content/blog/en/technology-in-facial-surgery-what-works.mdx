# Technology in Facial Surgery: What Actually Works?

Facial surgery, driven by the relentless search for rejuvenation and harmony, has witnessed constant technological evolution. However, amidst a vast range of innovations, the fundamental question arises: which technologies really add value and which are just passing fads? This article, with Dr. Robério Brandão's vision, explores the role of technology in facial surgery, critically analyzing what actually works to ensure safe, effective, and natural-looking results.

The [Modern Face](/en/blog/modern-face-concept-philosophy) philosophy, developed by Dr. Robério, prioritizes surgical mastery, deep anatomical knowledge, and patient safety above all else. Instead of blind adherence to the latest technological trends, Modern Face proposes a judicious and individualized approach, where technology serves as a support tool, not as a substitute for the surgeon's skill and experience.

## The Reality of Technology: What Delivers Value?

Not every technology available on the market contributes significantly to improving surgical results. Some technologies can be overly complex, high-cost, and with marginal effects.

It is essential that the surgeon adopts a critical stance and carefully evaluates each technology before incorporating it into their practice. The Modern Face philosophy offers a valuable framework for this evaluation:

1.  **Safety:** Does the technology increase patient safety? Does it reduce complication risks?
2.  **Efficacy:** Does the technology significantly improve surgical results?
3.  **Cost-benefit:** Is investment in technology justified by benefits it provides?
4.  **Ease of use:** Is the technology intuitive and easy to use? Does it really optimize surgeon's workflow?

### Technology that Adds Real Value

Based on these criteria, some technologies stand out for their positive impact on facial surgery:

*   **Ultrasound:** Essential for precise mapping of biostimulators and other injectable substances, allowing safer and more effective surgical planning. According to Dr. Robério, ultrasound has become "mandatory" for Modern Face.
*   **Microcannulas:** Allow precise infiltration of anesthetics and tumescent solutions, minimizing tissue trauma and bruising risk.
*   **High-frequency electric scalpel:** Offers precise cutting and coagulation, reducing bleeding and surgical time.
*   **3D imaging systems:** Assist in surgical planning and result simulation, improving predictability and patient satisfaction.

### The Trap of Technological Dependence

It is fundamental to avoid the trap of excessive dependence on technology, where surgeon's skill is replaced by belief that sophisticated equipment guarantees success. According to Dr. Robério, "technique surpasses expensive equipment."

## The Modern Face Philosophy: Prioritizing the Essential

Modern Face proposes a return to facial surgery fundamentals, prioritizing:

*   **Deep anatomical knowledge:** Detailed understanding of facial structures, their variations and interrelationships.
*   **Precise and refined surgical technique:** Manual skill and mastery of surgical techniques.
*   **Individualized clinical reasoning:** Careful evaluation of each patient, considering unique characteristics and specific goals.
*   **Direct Vision:** Ability to work with precision and safety, prioritizing touch and direct vision of anatomical structures.

### Pitanguy's Legacy

Dr. Robério Brandão emphasizes importance of valuing legacy of Ivo Pitanguy, one of greatest plastic surgeons of all time. Pitanguy, even without modern technologies, achieved remarkable results through his technical mastery, anatomical knowledge, and artistic vision.

## The Power of Direct Vision: A Silent Revolution

In a world dominated by screens and sophisticated equipment, Dr. Robério Brandão proposes a return to surgery essence: **Direct Vision**. This technique, dispensing with endoscopes and other visualization devices, allows surgeon to:

*   **Feel tissue texture:** Identify anatomical planes and noble structures through touch.
*   **Visualize anatomy in its entirety:** Have three-dimensional and comprehensive view of surgical field.
*   **Make decisions based on experience and knowledge:** Trust own skill and intuition to guide procedure.

### Tactile Navigation: The Modern Surgeon's GPS

Direct Vision requires deep knowledge of facial anatomy and development of tactile navigation skills. Surgeon learns to identify bony landmarks and anatomical structures through touch, like a "GPS" guiding safely through facial labyrinth.

### Ultrasound: The Treasure Map in Biostimulator Era

In a scenario where most patients have already undergone procedures with biostimulators, ultrasound became indispensable tool to map distribution of these substances and plan surgery safely. According to Dr. Robério, "ultrasound became the new stethoscope of facial surgery."

## Modern Deep Neck: Less Equipment, More Result

The Modern Face philosophy also applies to neck surgery, the Deep Neck. Dr. Robério Brandão demonstrates it is possible to obtain remarkable results without need to remove submandibular gland, a procedure traditionally associated with significant risks.

Instead, Modern Face prioritizes:

*   **Liposuction:** Careful removal of excess superficial fat.
*   **Platysmaplasty:** Treatment of platysma muscle to improve cervical contour.
*   **Glandular Suspension:** Suspension techniques to reposition submandibular gland without removing it.

## Anatomy Relevant to This Procedure

Anatomical knowledge is fundamental to understand how results are achieved safely and effectively.

### Key Structures

The face is composed of layers that must be understood together:

- **Skin**: most superficial layer, reflecting aging through wrinkles and sagging
- **Subcutaneous tissue**: contains fat that redistributes with age
- **SMAS (Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System)**: fundamental layer connecting muscles to skin
- **Facial muscles**: responsible for expression and dynamic support
- **Retaining ligaments**: anchor skin to facial skeleton
- **Facial nerves**: control movement and sensitivity

### Surgical Planes

In Modern Face philosophy, we work in specific planes:

- **Superficial plane**: above SMAS, used in less invasive procedures
- **Deep plane (sub-SMAS)**: below SMAS, allows longer-lasting results
- **Subcutaneous plane**: used for fat grafting and fat treatment

### Why This Matters

Understanding anatomy explains:

- Why certain procedures last longer than others
- How natural results are achieved
- Why surgeon's experience is crucial
- How complications can be avoided

> "Respect for anatomy is what separates a natural result from an artificial one. In Modern Face, each structure has its role and must be preserved or repositioned with precision." — Dr. Robério Brandão
