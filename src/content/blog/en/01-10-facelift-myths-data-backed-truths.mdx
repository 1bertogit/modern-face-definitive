# 10 [Facelift](/en/blog/facelift-complete-guide) Myths: Data-Backed Truths

The facelift, or rhytidectomy, is one of the most sought-after procedures for facial rejuvenation. However, the surgery is still shrouded in many misconceptions that can scare or confuse patients.

In this article, we will demystify 10 common myths about facelifts, supported by data and the Modern Face philosophy created by Dr. Robério Brandão, to provide clear and accurate information.

## Myth 1: Facelift Leaves Very Visible Scars

**Reality:** Modern facelift techniques, especially the Modern Face philosophy, are designed to minimize scars.

Incisions are made in discreet areas, such as:
- Inside the hairline (temporal and pre-capillary region)
- Behind the ear (retroauricular region)
- Inside the eyelids (blepharoplasty)

The [Endomidface](/en/blog/endomidface-complete-guide) technique, for example, uses a temporal incision of approximately 5 cm, completely hidden in the hair.

> "Modern Face seeks elegance in simplicity, prioritizing natural results with minimal visible scarring," states Dr. Robério Brandão.

## Myth 2: Facelift is Very Risky

**Reality:** Like any surgical procedure, a facelift involves risks. However, when performed by a qualified and experienced plastic surgeon, the risks are relatively low.

Data from a series of cases documented by Dr. Robério Brandão (212 patients) show a complication rate of less than 3% and zero cases of permanent nerve injury.

> "Safety is the fundamental pillar of Modern Face. We have developed techniques and protocols to minimize risks and ensure predictable results," emphasizes Dr. Robério.

## Myth 3: Facelift Leaves the Face Looking Artificial

**Reality:** Facelift techniques have evolved significantly, seeking natural and long-lasting results.

The Modern Face philosophy prioritizes restoring facial volumes and repositioning tissues harmoniously, rather than simply "stretching" the skin.

The Endomidface technique, for example, lifts the midface vertically, preserving expressiveness and avoiding the "stretched" or "plastic" look.

## Myth 4: Facelift is Only for Older People

**Reality:** Although it is more common in people with advanced signs of aging, a facelift can be an option for younger patients who wish to correct early sagging and improve facial contour.

In these cases, Modern Face offers minimally invasive techniques, such as temporoplasty and Endomidface, which can provide significant results with faster recovery.

> "Facelifts don't have an age, they have an indication. The important thing is to evaluate the needs and expectations of each patient and offer the most appropriate solution," explains Dr. Robério Brandão.

## Myth 5: Facelift Recovery is Very Long and Painful

**Reality:** Minimally invasive techniques, such as Modern Face, offer a faster and more comfortable recovery compared to traditional methods.

Most patients can return to social activities within a few days, with minimal swelling and bruising.

The Modern Face optimized recovery protocol includes:
- Minimally invasive surgical techniques
- Multimodal analgesia
- Manual lymphatic drainage

> "Our goal is to provide complete rejuvenation with the least possible impact on the patient's life," says Dr. Robério Brandão.

## Myth 6: Facelift Does Not Last Long

**Reality:** The duration of facelift results depends on several factors, including the technique used, the quality of the patient's skin, and their lifestyle habits.

However, modern techniques like Modern Face offer long-lasting results, with improvements maintained for many years.

Follow-up data from Dr. Robério Brandão's patients show that, on average, 70-75% of initial results are maintained after 5 years.

[Table: Comparison of result duration between different facelift techniques.]

| Technique | Average Duration |
|---|---|
| Traditional Facelift | 5-10 years |
| Modern Face (Endomidface) | 10-15 years |

## Myth 7: Facelift Does Not Improve the Neck

**Reality:** Although the main focus is the face, a facelift can have a positive impact on the neck, especially when combined with other procedures like Deep Neck.

Modern Face offers a comprehensive approach to facial rejuvenation, treating both the face and neck to ensure harmonious and balanced results.

> "The neck is the foundation of the face. It's no use having a rejuvenated face if the neck gives away your age," states Dr. Robério Brandão.

## Myth 8: Only Surgical Facelift Rejuvenates

**Reality:** There are several non-surgical options that can provide satisfactory facial rejuvenation, depending on the patient's needs and expectations.

Botulinum toxin, fillers, collagen biostimulators, and office-based technologies can soften wrinkles, restore volume, and improve skin texture, postponing or even avoiding the need for surgery.

However, for cases of advanced sagging and loss of bone support, a facelift may be the most effective option to restore facial harmony and provide long-lasting results.

## Myth 9: Facelift Leaves the Face Stretched

**Reality:** Modern facelift techniques are designed to avoid the "stretched" or "artificial" look that was common in older surgeries.

Modern Face prioritizes the restoration of facial volumes and the repositioning of tissues naturally, rather than simply "stretching" the skin.

The vertical traction vector used in the Endomidface technique ensures a softer and more expressive result, preserving the patient's identity.

## Myth 10: Any Plastic Surgeon Can Perform a Good Facelift

**Reality:** Like any complex surgical procedure, a facelift requires a high level of skill, knowledge, and experience on the part of the surgeon.

It is fundamental to choose a qualified professional, with specific training in facial surgery and proven experience in the desired technique.

Modern Face offers complete and structured training for plastic surgeons who wish to master the most modern and safe facelift techniques.

## Essential Questions for the Consultation

A productive consultation is fundamental to the procedure's success. Prepare with the right questions.

### About the Surgeon's Experience

1. **"How many procedures similar to my case have you performed?"** — Volume of cases is an indicator of experience
2. **"Can I see before and after photos of patients with characteristics similar to mine?"** — Real results are the best reference
3. **"What is your specific training in facial surgery?"** — Specialization makes a difference in results

### About the Proposed Technique

4. **"Why do you recommend this specific technique for my case?"** — Understand the clinical reasoning
5. **"What are the alternatives and why is this the best option?"** — Compare approaches
6. **"Where will the scars be and how do they evolve over time?"** — Realistic expectations

### About Risks and Recovery

7. **"What are the most common risks and how are they managed?"** — Transparency is essential
8. **"How long will I be away from normal activities?"** — Proper planning
9. **"What type of anesthesia will be used?"** — Anesthetic safety
10. **"What is the postoperative follow-up protocol?"** — Continuous support

### Signs of a Good Surgeon

- Answers your questions clearly and patiently
- Shows real results from previous cases
- Discusses risks transparently
- Does not promise unrealistic results
- Has adequate team and structure

## Red Flags in Post-Operative

Knowing the warning signs allows for early identification of any complications and quick action.

### When to Seek the Surgeon Immediately

Some signs require urgent medical evaluation:

- **Active bleeding** that does not stop with light compression for 10-15 minutes
- **Fever** above 38°C (100.4°F), especially if accompanied by chills
- **Intense and sudden pain** not controlled with prescribed medication
- **Abrupt asymmetry** — much larger swelling on one side may indicate hematoma
- **Skin color change** — paleness or darkening in specific areas
- **Purulent discharge** with an unpleasant odor

### Normal Signs (Do Not Worry)

These symptoms are expected and do not require concern:

- **Moderate edema** in the first few days, especially in the morning
- **Ecchymosis** (bruises) that change color progressively
- **Tingling or temporary numbness** in the operated area
- **Sensation of tightness** as tissues heal
- **Small temporary asymmetries** due to irregular edema
- **Difficulty smiling** or moving the face in the first few days

### Safety Protocol

In case of doubt, follow this protocol:

1. **Document** — take photos and note symptoms
2. **Contact** — call the surgeon's team
3. **Do not self-medicate** — avoid non-prescribed medications
4. **Stay calm** — most complications are manageable

> "At Modern Face, every patient receives a direct communication channel for emergencies. Safety is not a luxury, it is a priority." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## What to Expect: Recovery Timeline

Recovery is a journey that requires patience and specific care at each stage. Knowing what to expect helps reduce anxiety and optimize results.

### First 24-48 Hours

This is the most delicate period. It is normal to experience:

- **Moderate to intense edema**: swelling is maximal during this period
- **Ecchymosis**: purple spots may appear and are a natural part of healing
- **Manageable discomfort**: pain is generally mild to moderate, controlled with prescribed painkillers
- **Need for absolute rest**: avoid sudden movements and keep the head elevated

### First Week (Days 3-7)

From the third day, you will start to notice progressive improvements:

- Edema begins to decrease gradually
- Ecchymosis changes color (purple → green → yellow)
- Stitches and dressings may be removed as per medical guidance
- Light activities can be resumed with caution

### Weeks 2-4

Important transition phase:

- Gradual return to social and professional activities
- Residual edema still present, but less noticeable
- Result begins to define itself, although not yet definitive
- Lymphatic drainage massages may be indicated

### Months 1-3

The final result consolidates progressively:

- Tissues settle into their definitive position
- Scars mature and become less visible
- Sensitivity returns gradually to normal
- Final result visible between 3-6 months

> "Patience is key. The final result of a facial procedure can only be evaluated after 6 months, when all tissues have stabilized." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## Detailed Post-Operative Care

The procedure's success depends on both the surgical technique and post-operative care.

### First Days: Critical Phase

In this phase, small precautions make a big difference:

- **Elevated rest**: keep head elevated at 30-45° even when sleeping
- **Cold compresses**: apply in the first 48h to reduce edema
- **Strict medication**: follow exactly the prescribed schedules
- **Light diet**: prefer soft foods and avoid excessive chewing
- **Abundant hydration**: water helps with tissue recovery

### First Week: Intermediate Care

As healing advances:

- **Careful hygiene**: clean the area as directed, without rubbing
- **Avoid sun exposure**: use a hat and sunscreen when going out is necessary
- **Gentle facial movements**: avoid exaggerated expressions
- **Adequate sleep**: the body recovers mainly during sleep
- **Avoid alcohol and tobacco**: both impair healing

### Weeks 2-4: Gradual Return

Return to activities should be progressive:

- **Light activities**: short walks are allowed
- **Remote work**: can be resumed as comfortable
- **Light makeup**: generally allowed after 2 weeks
- **Moderate exercise**: only with medical clearance
- **Lymphatic drainage**: indicated to accelerate recovery

### What to Avoid

Throughout the recovery period:

- Direct sun exposure on operated areas
- Intense physical activities before clearance
- Alcohol consumption in the first 2 weeks
- Smoking (ideally stop 4 weeks before and after)
- Non-prescribed anti-inflammatories
- Sudden movements with the face

## Conclusion

A facelift is a surgery that can provide incredible results in facial rejuvenation. However, it is important to be well-informed and debunk the myths surrounding the procedure to make a conscious and safe decision.

Modern Face offers an innovative and personalized approach to facelifts, focusing on natural results, safety, and optimized recovery.

If you are considering a facelift, schedule a consultation with a qualified plastic surgeon to discuss your options and expectations.
