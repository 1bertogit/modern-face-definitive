# Platysmal Bands: Anatomy, Causes, and Surgical Correction

Platysmal bands, often described as vertical "cords" or "lines" in the neck, are a common complaint for both men and women as they age. This article details the anatomy of platysmal bands, the underlying causes of their formation, and the most modern and effective surgical treatment options, including Dr. Robério Brandão's Modern Face philosophy.

## Detailed Platysma Anatomy

To understand platysmal bands, it is fundamental to know the anatomy of the platysma muscle. This thin, superficial muscle extends from the mandible and cheek region to the clavicle and upper chest.

Unlike many muscles that have well-defined bony insertions, the platysma inserts into the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Its medial edges, which meet at the midline of the neck, do not always fuse completely. This lack of complete fusion, combined with loss of muscle elasticity and decrease in subcutaneous tissue with age, contributes to the formation of platysmal bands.

### Innervation and Function

The platysma is innervated by the cervical branch of the facial nerve. Its contraction causes a variety of facial expressions, including neck tension, jaw depression, and slight lowering of the corners of the mouth.

Although the platysma contributes to facial expression, its function is not as critical as that of other facial muscles. This means that surgical manipulation of the platysma generally does not result in significant functional deficits, providing adequate precautions are taken to protect the marginal mandibular nerve, as detailed in the [Modern Face](/en/blog/modern-face-concept-philosophy) philosophy.

## Causes of Platysmal Band Development

Platysmal bands are the result of a combination of aging-related factors and individual anatomy.

### Aging
Over the years, the platysma muscle loses its elasticity and tone. The medial edges of the muscle, which are already naturally prone to separate, become even more prominent as the underlying subcutaneous tissue decreases.

### Individual Anatomy
Individual platysma anatomy varies significantly among people. Some people may have more complete fusion of the medial edges of the platysma, while others may have more pronounced separation from youth.

### Habits and Facial Mimicry
Repeated contraction of the platysma muscle over time can contribute to the development and prominence of the bands.

## Non-Surgical Treatment Options

For mild to moderate cases of platysmal bands, non-surgical treatment options may be considered.

### Botulinum Toxin (Botox)
Injections of botulinum toxin into the platysma muscle can relax the bands and reduce their appearance. However, results are temporary, typically lasting three to six months.

Botulinum toxin works by blocking the release of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter responsible for muscle contraction. By selectively relaxing platysmal bands, botulinum toxin can smooth neck contour and reduce the appearance of "cords".

### Other Approaches
Other non-surgical approaches, such as radiofrequency and microfocused ultrasound, can help improve skin texture and reduce sagging but have limited impact on correcting prominent platysmal bands.

## Surgical Correction of Platysmal Bands

For more advanced cases of platysmal bands, surgical correction may be the most effective and long-lasting option. There are several surgical approaches to treat platysmal bands, including platysmaplasty and Deep Neck.

### Platysmaplasty
Platysmaplasty involves direct manipulation of the platysma muscle to smooth the bands. There are different platysmaplasty techniques, including:

* **Medial Platysmaplasty:** The medial edges of the platysma muscle are sutured together at the midline of the neck, creating a muscle "corset" that supports and redefines neck contour.

* **Lateral Platysmaplasty:** The platysma muscle is sectioned and repositioned laterally, smoothing the bands and creating a smoother contour.

### Deep Neck
Deep Neck is a more comprehensive approach aiming to treat not just the platysma but also other underlying structures contributing to neck aging.

The [Deep Neck](/en/blog/deep-neck-complete-guide) technique involves:

* **Liposuction:** Removal of excess fat under the chin and along the neck.

* **Platysmaplasty:** Manipulation and suturing of the platysma muscle, as described above.

* **Myotomy:** Partial section of the digastric muscle to reduce volume and improve contour.

* **Glandulectomy:** In some cases, partial or total removal of submandibular glands may be considered to reduce volume in the upper neck.

* **Digastric Shaving:** Controlled reduction of digastric muscle volume for a more refined contour.

[Table: Comparison between Platysmaplasty and Deep Neck]

| Feature | Platysmaplasty | Deep Neck |
|---|---|---|
| Focus | Platysma muscle | Platysma, fat, deep muscles |
| Invasiveness | Lower | Higher |
| Results | Improvement of bands | Comprehensive contour improvement |
| Recovery | Faster | Longer |
| Indications | Mild to moderate cases | Advanced cases |

### The Modern Face Approach
Dr. Robério Brandão, creator of the [Modern Face](/en/blog/modern-face-concept-philosophy) philosophy, proposes a specific approach for treating platysmal bands, focusing on safety and natural, long-lasting results.

In Modern Face, Deep Neck is performed **without routine removal of the submandibular gland**, which is considered a high-risk step. Instead, the technique focuses on:

* **Plication:** Suturing medial edges of the platysma to create support and definition.

* **Liposuction:** Removal of excess fat to refine contour.

* **Myotomy:** Partial section of the digastric muscle to reduce volume and improve definition.

* **Glandular Loop:** Innovative technique created by Dr. Robério to suspend and reposition the submandibular gland without removing it, improving neck contour.

According to Dr. Robério Brandão, the key to success in treating platysmal bands is individualizing the approach based on each patient's anatomy and needs:

> "There is no single solution for all cases. It is fundamental to carefully evaluate the patient's anatomy and adapt the surgical technique to achieve the best possible results with the lowest risk."

## Post-Operative Recovery

Recovery after surgery for platysmal band correction varies depending on the technique used.

After platysmaplasty, patients can expect some swelling, bruising, and discomfort, which usually decrease within a few weeks.

After Deep Neck, recovery may be longer, with more swelling and bruising. However, results tend to be longer-lasting and comprehensive.

## Risks and Complications

Like any surgical procedure, correction of platysmal bands carries certain risks and potential complications, including:

* Bleeding
* Infection
* Unfavorable scarring
* Nerve injury (resulting in muscle weakness or paralysis)
* Asymmetry
* Recurrence of bands

It is crucial to choose a qualified and experienced plastic surgeon who can carefully evaluate your individual case and discuss potential risks and benefits of each treatment option.

## Relevant Anatomy for This Procedure

Anatomical knowledge is fundamental to understand how results are achieved safely and effectively.

### Key Structures

The face is composed of layers that must be understood together:

- **Skin**: the most superficial layer, reflecting aging through wrinkles and sagging
- **Subcutaneous tissue**: contains fat that redistributes with age
- **SMAS (Superficial Musculo-Aponeurotic System)**: fundamental layer connecting muscles to skin
- **Facial muscles**: responsible for expression and dynamic support
- **Retaining ligaments**: anchor skin to the facial skeleton
- **Facial nerves**: control movement and sensation

### Surgical Planes

In the Modern Face philosophy, we work in specific planes:

- **Superficial plane**: above the SMAS, used in less invasive procedures
- **Deep plane (sub-SMAS)**: below the SMAS, allows for longer-lasting results
- **Subcutaneous plane**: used for fat grafting and fat treatment

### Why This Matters

Understanding anatomy explains:

- Why certain procedures last longer than others
- How natural results are achieved
- Why the surgeon's experience is crucial
- How complications can be avoided

> "Respect for anatomy is what separates a natural result from an artificial one. In Modern Face, every structure has its role and must be preserved or repositioned with precision." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## Comparison: Techniques and Approaches

Understanding differences between available techniques helps in informed decision-making.

### Overview of Approaches

| Aspect | Traditional Techniques | Modern Face |
|---|---|---|
| **Surgical plane** | Generally superficial | Deep (sub-SMAS) |
| **Traction vector** | Predominantly lateral | Vertically anatomically correct |
| **Incisions** | Extensive, multiple areas | Minimal, strategically positioned |
| **Recovery** | 2-4 weeks | 7-14 days on average |
| **Durability** | 5-7 years | 10-15 years |
| **Naturalness** | Risk of "stretched" look | Preserves natural expression |

### Advantages of the Modern Approach

The Modern Face technique offers specific benefits:

- **More natural results**: vertical vector respects facial anatomy
- **Shorter recovery time**: minimally invasive techniques speed healing
- **Superior durability**: work in the deep plane offers longer-lasting support
- **Less visible scars**: strategic and smaller incisions
- **Preservation of expressiveness**: face remains natural and mobile

### When Each Technique is Indicated

Technique choice depends on individual factors:

- **Degree of aging**: more advanced cases may require more comprehensive approaches
- **Areas of concern**: midface, lower face, or neck have specific techniques
- **Patient expectations**: balance between desired result and acceptable recovery
- **History of previous procedures**: revisions require special planning
