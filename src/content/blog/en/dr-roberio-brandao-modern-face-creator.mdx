# Dr. Robério Brandão: Creator of Endomidface and Father of Modern Face

The name of Dr. Robério Brandão resonates in the world of facial plastic surgery as a synonym for innovation, safety, and natural results. Creator of the Modern Face philosophy and the Direct Vision Endomidface technique, he revolutionized the way surgeons approach facial rejuvenation, prioritizing technical mastery over dependence on expensive equipment and patient safety above all else. With over 18 years of experience and more than 1,500 facial surgeries performed, Dr. Robério personifies the continuous pursuit of excellence and the passion for transforming lives through the art and science of surgery.

## A Trajectory Dedicated to Innovation and Safety
Dr. Robério's journey in plastic surgery began in 2006, driven by the desire to offer his patients increasingly better and more natural results. In 2007, he became one of the pioneers in the use of video-endoscopy in facial surgeries in his region, seeking minimally invasive techniques to reduce scars and accelerate recovery.

However, his quest for improvement did not stop there. Over years of experience, Dr. Robério realized the limitations of traditional video-endoscopy, such as the dissociation between vision and touch and the dependence on expensive and complex equipment. This dissatisfaction led him to develop the Direct Vision Endomidface technique, an innovative approach that allows lifting the [midface](/en/blog/midface-rejuvenation) without the use of an endoscope, through a superior access and with a safe dissection plane.

"The Modern Face philosophy was born from the need to offer my patients what is most modern and safe in facial surgery," affirms Dr. Robério. "I believe that true mastery lies in the combination of refined technique, deep knowledge of anatomy, and treatment personalization for each patient."

## The Modern Face Philosophy: Elegance, Safety, and Optimized Recovery
The Modern Face philosophy, idealized by Dr. Robério Brandão, represents a new era in facial plastic surgery, based on three fundamental pillars:

*   **Non-Negotiable Safety:** Maximum priority is patient safety, seeking minimally invasive techniques and avoiding areas of anatomical risk.

*   **Elegance in Simplicity:** Natural and harmonious results are achieved through refined and precise techniques, without the need for complex equipment or excessively invasive procedures.

*   **Optimized Recovery:** Modern Face aims to provide a faster and more comfortable recovery for the patient, allowing an early return to daily activities.

"Modern Face is not just a technique, but a work philosophy that guides all my decisions," explains Dr. Robério. "I always seek the balance between aesthetic excellence and patient safety, offering natural and long-lasting results with the least possible impact on their life."

## Direct Vision Endomidface: The Midface Revolution
The Direct Vision Endomidface technique, developed by Dr. Robério Brandão, is a milestone in facial rejuvenation surgery. This innovative approach allows treatment of the midface in a minimally invasive way, without the need for large incisions or the use of an endoscope.

### Benefits of the Direct Vision Endomidface Technique:
*   **Minimal Scars:** The technique is performed through small incisions in the temporal region, which remain completely hidden within the scalp.

*   **Rapid Recovery:** The minimally invasive approach results in less tissue trauma, reducing swelling and post-operative recovery time.

*   **Natural Results:** The technique allows precise repositioning of midface tissues, restoring volume and projection of the malar region naturally and harmoniously.

*   **Enhanced Safety:** The Direct Vision technique dispenses with the use of an endoscope, allowing the surgeon to have a clearer and more precise view of anatomical structures, minimizing the risk of nerve and vascular injuries.

*   **Suitable for Patients with Biostimulators:** The Endomidface technique is especially indicated for patients who have already undergone procedures with biostimulators, such as Sculptra and Radiesse, as it allows bypassing the fibrosis area caused by these substances.

"With the Endomidface technique, it is possible to obtain surprising results in midface rejuvenation, with a much shorter recovery time and a much lower risk of complications," guarantees Dr. Robério.

## The Legacy of the Father of Modern Face
Dr. Robério Brandão does not limit himself to being a talented and innovative surgeon. He also dedicates himself to sharing his knowledge and experience with other professionals in the field through courses, workshops, and mentorships. His goal is to train a new generation of facial surgeons capable of offering excellent results with safety and ethics.

"I believe that knowledge exchange is fundamental for the advancement of plastic surgery," affirms Dr. Robério. "Ideally, I dedicate myself to teaching the Modern Face philosophy and the Endomidface technique to other surgeons so that they too can transform their patients' lives."

## Post-Operative Warning Signs

Knowing warning signs allows recognizing any complication early and acting quickly.

### When to Seek Surgeon Immediately

Some signs require urgent medical evaluation:

- **Active bleeding** that does not stop with light compression for 10-15 minutes
- **Fever** above 38°C (100.4°F), especially if accompanied by chills
- **Intense and sudden pain** not controlled with prescribed medication
- **Abrupt asymmetry** — much larger swelling on one side may indicate hematoma
- **Skin color change** — paleness or darkening in specific areas
- **Purulent discharge** with unpleasant odor

### Normal Signs (Do Not Worry)

These symptoms are expected and do not require concern:

- **Moderate edema** in the first days, especially in the morning
- **Bruising** (purple spots) that change color progressively
- **Tingling or numbness** temporarily in the operated area
- **Pulling sensation** as tissues heal
- **Small temporary asymmetries** due to irregular edema
- **Difficulty smiling** or moving face in the first days

### Safety Protocol

In case of doubt, follow this protocol:

1. **Document** — take photos and note symptoms
2. **Contact** — call the surgeon's team
3. **Do not self-medicate** — avoid non-prescribed medications
4. **Stay calm** — most complications are manageable

## What to Expect: Recovery Timeline

Recovery is a journey that requires patience and specific care in each phase. Knowing what to expect helps reduce anxiety and optimize results.

### First 24-48 Hours

This is the most delicate period. It is normal to present:

- **Moderate to intense edema**: swelling is maximum in this period
- **Bruising**: purple spots may appear and are a natural part of healing
- **Controllable discomfort**: pain is generally mild to moderate, controlled with prescribed painkillers
- **Need for absolute rest**: avoid sudden movements and keep head elevated

### First Week (Days 3-7)

From the third day, you will start to notice progressive improvements:

- Swelling begins to decrease gradually
- Bruises change color (purple → green → yellow)
- Stitches and dressings can be removed as per medical guidance
- Light activities can be resumed with caution

### Weeks 2-4

Important transition phase:

- Gradual return to social and professional activities
- Residual edema still present, but less noticeable
- Result begins to define itself, although not yet definitive
- Lymphatic drainage massages may be indicated

### Months 1-3

Final result consolidates progressively:

- Tissues settle in their definitive position
- Scars mature and become less visible
- Sensitivity returns gradually to normal
- Final result visible between 3-6 months

> "Patience is fundamental. The final result of a facial procedure can only be evaluated after 6 months, when all tissues have already stabilized." — Dr. Robério Brandão


## Essential Questions for Consultation

A well-utilized consultation is fundamental for the procedure's success. Prepare with the right questions.

### About Surgeon's Experience

1. **"How many procedures similar to my case have you performed?"** — Case volume indicates experience
2. **"Can I see before and after photos of patients with characteristics similar to mine?"** — Real results are the best reference
3. **"What is your specific training in facial surgery?"** — Specialization makes a difference in results

### About Proposed Technique

4. **"Why do you recommend this specific technique for my case?"** — Understand clinical reasoning
5. **"What are the alternatives and why is this the best option?"** — Compare approaches
6. **"Where will the scars be and how do they evolve over time?"** — Realistic expectations

### About Risks and Recovery

7. **"What are the most common risks and how are they managed?"** — Transparency is essential
8. **"How long will I be away from normal activities?"** — Proper planning
9. **"What type of anesthesia will be used?"** — Anesthetic safety
10. **"What is the post-operative follow-up protocol?"** — Continuous support

### Signs of a Good Surgeon

- Answers your questions clearly and patiently
- Shows real results from previous cases
- Discusses risks transparently
- Does not promise unrealistic results
- Is part of an adequate team and structure


## Detailed Post-Operative Care

Procedure success depends on both surgical technique and post-operative care.

### First Days: Critical Phase

In this phase, small precautions make a big difference:

- **Elevated rest**: keep head elevated at 30-45° even when sleeping
- **Cold compresses**: apply in first 48h to reduce edema
- **Strict medication**: follow exactly prescribed schedules
- **Light diet**: prefer soft foods and avoid excessive chewing
- **Abundant hydration**: water helps with tissue recovery

### First Week: Intermediate Care

As healing advances:

- **Careful hygiene**: clean area as directed, without rubbing
- **Avoid sun exposure**: use hat and sunscreen when necessary to go out
- **Gentle facial movements**: avoid exaggerated expressions
- **Adequate sleep**: body recovers mainly during sleep
- **Avoid alcohol and tobacco**: both impair healing

### Weeks 2-4: Gradual Return

Return to activities should be progressive:

- **Light activities**: short walks are allowed
- **Remote work**: can be resumed as comfortable
- **Light makeup**: generally allowed after 2 weeks
- **Moderate exercise**: only with medical clearance
- **Lymphatic drainage**: indicated to accelerate recovery

### What to Avoid

Throughout recovery period:

- Direct sun exposure on operated areas
- Intense physical activities before clearance
- Alcohol consumption in first 2 weeks
- Smoking (ideally stop 4 weeks before and after)
- Non-prescribed anti-inflammatories
- Sudden movements with face
