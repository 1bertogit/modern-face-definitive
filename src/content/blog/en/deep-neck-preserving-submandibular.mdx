faq:
  - question: "Why do some surgeons remove submandibular gland in Deep Neck?"
    answer: "Gland removal was proposed to create more defined cervical contour. However, this approach brings significant risks (marginal nerve injury, dry mouth, swallowing difficulty) and results that can be obtained more safely with conservative techniques."
  - question: "Is it possible to have good neck result without removing gland?"
    answer: "Yes. Modern Face technique uses 'Glandular Sling' — gland repositioning and containment with sutures — that defines contour without removal risks. Result is elegant and lasting."
  - question: "What is 'Glandular Sling' technique?"
    answer: "It's a containment technique where sutures are passed around submandibular gland, repositioning it superiorly and medially. This improves mandibular angle contour without removing functional tissue."
  - question: "What are risks of removing submandibular gland?"
    answer: "Main risks include: marginal mandibular nerve injury (smile asymmetry), xerostomia (dry mouth), swallowing difficulty, and seroma formation. These risks are completely avoided with preservation techniques."
  - question: "What is platysmaplasty and how does it help cervical contour?"
    answer: "Platysmaplasty is suturing of platysma muscle medial borders at neck midline. This creates muscular 'corset' that defines cervicomental angle and supports deep tissues."
  - question: "Is digastric shaving safe?"
    answer: "Yes, when done under direct vision. Shaving (thinning) of anterior digastric belly removes excess muscle volume that can compromise submental contour, without compromising muscle function."

The neck is one of the most challenging regions in facial surgery. Elegant cervical
contour requires work on multiple structures: skin, fat, platysma muscle, subplatysmal fat
and, frequently, submandibular gland.
Historically, some surgeons proposed **submandibular gland removal** to create
more defined contours. The **Modern Face Deep Neck** technique demonstrates this
is unnecessary — and risky.

## Why Not Remove Submandibular Gland?
### ⚠️ Gland Removal Risks
- 
•
**Marginal Mandibular Nerve Injury**
Causes lower lip paralysis — smile asymmetry. May be permanent.
- 
•
**Xerostomia (Dry Mouth)**
Submandibular gland produces 70% of resting saliva. Bilateral removal causes
significant discomfort.
- 
•
**Swallowing Difficulty**
Saliva is essential to form food bolus. Patients may have dysphagia.
- 
•
**Seroma and Salivary Fistula**
Postoperative complications that may require reoperation.
- 
•
**Contour Depression**
Removal can create "hole" in cervical contour over time.
These risks aren't justifiable when techniques exist that deliver equivalent or superior
results without removing functional tissue.

## Modern Face Approach: Preserve and Reposition
Modern Face Deep Neck uses set of techniques that create elegant cervical contour without
removing functional structures:
01
### Platysmaplasty
Suturing of platysma muscle medial borders at midline. Creates muscular "corset" that
defines cervicomental angle.
**Benefit:** Lasting support, cervical angle definition, platysmal bands correction.
02
### Glandular Sling
Sutures passed around submandibular gland, repositioning it superiorly and medially.
Gland is "suspended" in more favorable position.
**Benefit:** Mandibular angle contour improvement without removing functional
tissue.
03
### Digastric Shaving
Controlled thinning of digastric muscle anterior belly. Reduces excess muscle volume
that can compromise submental contour.
**Benefit:** Submental profile improvement without compromising muscle function.
04
### Lateral Crevassi
Release and repositioning of lateral neck structures through specific access, allowing
vertical tissue traction.
**Benefit:** Lateral cervical and mandibular contour definition.
05
### Selective Lipectomy
Removal of supraplatysmal and subplatysmal fat in adequate amount. Not excessive
(avoids skeletal aspect) nor insufficient.
**Benefit:** Natural definition, without hollowing or residual excess.
