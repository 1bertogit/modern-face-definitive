## The Paradox of Weight Loss
Losing weight is excellent for health, but can reveal or create facial sagging. Skin that
was stretched over fat now has excess. The greater and faster the weight loss, the greater
the residual sagging tends to be.
## When to Consider Surgery?
- • Stable weight for at least **6-12 months**
- • Significant facial sagging causing concern
- • Good general health (no nutritional deficiencies)
- • Realistic expectations about results
## Differences in Post-Weight Loss Facelift
Patients who lost significant weight often need more skin excision than patients with
natural aging. Skin quality may also be different. Individual planning is essential.
