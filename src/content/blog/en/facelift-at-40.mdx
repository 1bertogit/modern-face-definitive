## The Concept of Preventive Facelift
At 40, many people begin to notice the first signs of facial aging that no longer respond
to non-surgical treatments. The **preventive facelift** addresses these early changes
before they become severe.
> "It's easier to maintain than restore. A lighter procedure at 40 can avoid more extensive
> surgery at 55."

## Signs Indicating Benefit at 40
- • Beginning of malar ptosis (descending cheek)
- • Deepening nasolabial fold
- • Loss of jawline definition
- • Dissatisfaction with non-surgical treatments
- • Family history of early aging
- • Significant sun exposure in the past
## Advantages of Operating Earlier
### Preserved Elasticity
Skin still has good quality, improves results.
### Faster Recovery
More efficient healing in younger patients.
### Smaller Procedure
Less extensive than would be needed years later.
### Lasting Result
Can postpone or eliminate need for second surgery.
## When NOT to Do It at 40
- • Minimal signs that respond to non-invasive treatments
- • Expectation of "never aging"
- • External pressure (partner, social media)
- • Comparison with photo filters
### Personalized Assessment
Each face ages uniquely. Individual assessment is essential.
