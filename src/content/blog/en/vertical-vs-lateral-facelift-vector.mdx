## What is Traction Vector?
In any facelift, tissues are repositioned in a specific direction — the **traction vector**. The chosen direction determines whether the result will be natural or artificial.
## Lateral Vector: The Problem
Older techniques pull back and up toward the ear. This causes:
- • "Pulled" or "windswept" appearance
- • Cheek flattening
- • Eye corner distortion
- • Widened pre-auricular scar
- • Result that "reveals" surgery
## Vertical Vector: The Solution
The vertical vector lifts tissues in the direction opposite to gravity. Results:
- • Restores natural malar volume
- • Maintains facial harmony
- • Doesn't distort structures
- • Result looks "refreshed", not "operated"
- • Less skin tension, better scar
> "Gravity pulls downward, not backward. Logical rejuvenation is to reverse this: lift
> vertically."
