# Lifting in Injected Face: Complete 2025 Guide for Surgeons

The growing popularity of injectable biostimulators like Sculptra® and Radiesse® has transformed the facial anatomy we encounter in the operating room. What was once predictable territory now frequently presents itself as a **minefield of fibrosis**, requiring new approaches and techniques to ensure the safety and efficacy of a facelift. This complete guide for 2025 offers a detailed overview of how to navigate these challenges, focusing on the techniques of the Modern Face philosophy, led by Dr. Robério Brandão.

With over 18 years of experience and more than 1,500 facial surgeries performed, Dr. Robério Brandão, creator of the Modern Face philosophy and the [Endomidface by Direct Vision](/en/blog/endomidface-complete-guide) technique, offers a protocol validated by 212 documented cases, with 0% permanent nerve injury. This guide is essential for surgeons seeking **predictable and safe results** in the era of biostimulators.

## The Problem: Fibrosis Induced by Biostimulators

Biostimulators, although effective for stimulating collagen production, induce a fibrotic process in the Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System (SMAS) layer. This fibrosis, often described as a **"biological superglue"**, can adhere to surrounding tissues, making surgical dissection more challenging and increasing the risk of nerve injuries.

### Where Fibrosis is Most Common

Fibrosis tends to concentrate in the **fixed lateral SMAS**, the area of the cheek closest to the ear. This is a critical zone, as it is traversed by important branches of the facial nerve.

### The Risks of Ignoring Fibrosis

When performing a traditional facelift on an injected face, the surgeon may face:

*   **Difficulty in dissection:** Fibrosis makes SMAS detachment more difficult and time-consuming.
*   **Increased risk of nerve injury:** Tissue adhesion to the facial nerve increases the probability of injuries during dissection.
*   **Unpredictable results:** Fibrosis can distort facelift results, leading to asymmetries and irregularities.

## The Solution: Modern Face Philosophy and Endomidface by Direct Vision

The Modern Face philosophy, developed by Dr. Robério Brandão, offers an innovative and safe approach for facelifts in injected faces. The central pillar of this philosophy is the **prioritization of safety** and the **minimization of surgical trauma**.

### Endomidface by Direct Vision: A Safe Anatomical Shortcut

The [Endomidface](/en/blog/endomidface-complete-guide) by Direct Vision technique is a key component of Modern Face. It offers an **anatomical shortcut** that bypasses the zone of fibrosis, minimizing the risk of nerve injury.

#### How It Works:

1.  **Superior Access:** Instead of approaching the SMAS laterally (as in traditional deep plane), Endomidface uses a temporal incision, allowing access to the SMAS **from top to bottom**.
2.  **Bypassing Fibrosis:** This superior access allows the surgeon to bypass the area of fibrosis, working in a more superficial plane and avoiding direct dissection in the adhesion zone.
3.  **Direct Vision:** Unlike endoscopic techniques, Endomidface is performed under **direct vision**, without the need for cameras or complex equipment. This allows better visualization of anatomical structures and more precise control of dissection.

### Benefits of Endomidface in Injected Faces:

*   **Reduced Risk of Nerve Injury:** By bypassing fibrosis, Endomidface minimizes the risk of damage to facial nerve branches.
*   **Natural and Long-Lasting Results:** The technique allows precise tissue repositioning, restoring volume and facial harmony naturally and lastingly.
*   **Faster Recovery:** The minimally invasive approach results in less edema and bruising, allowing a faster return to normal activities.
*   **Less Reliance on Grafts and Fillers:** By repositioning tissues structurally, Endomidface reduces the need for fat grafts or fillers to restore facial volume.

## The Modern Face Protocol: Step-by-Step for Lifting in Injected Face

Success in lifting an injected face depends on careful planning and precise execution of a proven protocol. The Modern Face protocol, developed by Dr. Robério Brandão, offers a step-by-step guide to ensure procedure safety and efficacy.

### 1. Detailed Pre-Operative Evaluation: Mapping Fibrosis Anatomy

Pre-operative evaluation is crucial to identify the presence and extent of fibrosis in the SMAS.

*   **Patient history:** Record all previous aesthetic procedures, including the type and amount of biostimulators injected.
*   **Physical exam:** Palpate the face to identify areas of fibrosis and tissue adhesion.
*   **Ultrasound:** Use ultrasound to map the depth and extent of fibrosis in the SMAS.

### 2. Precise Surgical Marking: Planning the Access Route

Surgical marking should take into account the location of fibrosis and the dissection plane.

*   **Temporal incision:** Mark the temporal incision, following the hairline and avoiding areas of alopecia.
*   **Dissection plane:** Define the dissection plane, which should be **sub-SMAS** and as superficial as possible in the area of fibrosis.
*   **Nerve marking:** Identify and mark facial nerve branches to avoid injuries during dissection.

### 3. Refined Surgical Technique: Navigating Safely in the Sub-SMAS Plane

Dissection should be performed with care and precision, using delicate instruments and minimally invasive techniques.

*   **Access to SMAS:** Perform the temporal incision and access the SMAS, avoiding direct dissection in the fibrosis area.
*   **Release of ligaments:** Release SMAS retaining ligaments, such as the zygomatic ligament and masseteric ligament, to allow tissue repositioning.
*   **SMAS repositioning:** Reposition the SMAS in a higher position, using sutures and appropriate fixation techniques.

### 4. Modern Deep Neck: Harmonizing Cervical Contour

Often, a facelift in an injected face is combined with Modern Deep Neck to harmonize the cervical contour.

*   **Submental Access:** Make a small incision under the chin to access the submental region.
*   **Platysmaplasty:** Suture the edges of the platysma muscle to create better jawline definition.
*   **Liposuction:** Perform liposuction of submental fat to reduce neck volume.

### 5. Closure and Post-Operative Care: Optimizing Recovery

Incision closure should be performed with techniques that minimize skin tension and promote proper healing.

*   **Sutures:** Use absorbable sutures to close deep layers and non-absorbable sutures for the skin.
*   **Dressings:** Apply compressive dressings to reduce edema and bruising.
*   **Instructions:** Provide detailed instructions on post-operative care, including rest, wound hygiene, and medication use.

## Dr. Robério Brandão's Tips and Tricks for Lifting in Injected Face

Based on his vast experience, Dr. Robério Brandão shares some tips and tricks to optimize results of lifting in injected face:

*   **Use Ultrasound:** Ultrasound is a valuable tool to map fibrosis and plan surgery.
*   **Be Conservative in Liposuction:** Avoid aggressive liposuction, as it can remove natural skin support and lead to unwanted results.
*   **Do Not Fear Correcting Asymmetries:** Facial lifting can be used to correct existing facial asymmetries or those caused by previous procedures.
*   **Communicate Clearly with Patient:** Explain risks and benefits of procedure, as well as realistic expectations of results.

## Relevant Anatomy for This Procedure

Anatomical knowledge is fundamental to understand how results are achieved safely and effectively.

### Key Structures

The face is composed of layers that must be understood together:

- **Skin**: most superficial layer, reflecting aging through wrinkles and sagging
- **Subcutaneous tissue**: contains fat that redistributes with age
- **SMAS (Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System)**: fundamental layer connecting muscles to skin
- **Facial muscles**: responsible for expression and dynamic support
- **Retaining ligaments**: anchor skin to facial skeleton
- **Facial nerves**: control movement and sensitivity

### Surgical Planes

In Modern Face philosophy, we work in specific planes:

- **Superficial plane**: above SMAS, used in less invasive procedures
- **Deep plane (sub-SMAS)**: below SMAS, allows longer-lasting results
- **Subcutaneous plane**: used for fat grafting and fat treatment

### Why This Matters

Understanding anatomy explains:

- Why certain procedures last longer than others
- How natural results are achieved
- Why surgeon experience is crucial
- How complications can be avoided

> "Respect for anatomy is what separates natural result from artificial result. In Modern Face, each structure has its role and must be preserved or repositioned with precision." — Dr. Robério Brandão
