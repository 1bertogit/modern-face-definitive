# Direct Vision Browlift: Evolutionary Frontoplasty without Endoscope

The search for a rejuvenated and expressive look leads many patients to consider **Browlift**, also known as **Frontoplasty**. However, the traditional technique, often associated with endoscopy and extensive scars, can generate concerns. Dr. Robério Brandão, creator of the Modern Face philosophy, presents an innovative alternative: **Direct Vision Evolutionary Frontoplasty**, a minimally invasive, safe procedure with natural and long-lasting results.

This technique, which Dr. Robério Brandão has perfected over more than 18 years of experience and 1500 facial surgeries, redefines the concept of [facial rejuvenation](/en/blog/modern-face-concept-philosophy), offering an approach that values **harmony**, **expressiveness**, and patient **safety**.

## What is Direct Vision Evolutionary Frontoplasty?

Direct Vision Evolutionary Frontoplasty is a surgical technique that lifts eyebrows and smooths forehead lines, providing a younger and more rested appearance to the face. The differential of this technique lies in:

*   **Direct Vision Access:** Unlike endoscopic frontoplasty, which uses a monitor to guide the procedure, Dr. Robério Brandão's technique allows the surgeon to directly visualize the area to be treated, ensuring greater precision and control.

*   **Minimal and Strategically Positioned Incisions:** The incision, usually about 5 cm, is made within the scalp, making the scar practically imperceptible.

*   **Natural and Long-Lasting Results:** The technique aims to reposition facial structures harmoniously, lifting eyebrows and smoothing forehead lines without creating an artificial or "stretched" look.

*   **Enhanced Safety:** The Modern Face philosophy, which guides the technique, prioritizes patient safety at all stages of the procedure.

### The Modern Face Philosophy in Frontoplasty

Direct Vision Evolutionary Frontoplasty is aligned with Modern Face principles, which include:

*   **Individualization of Treatment:** Each patient is unique, and the surgical plan must be adapted to their needs and facial characteristics.

*   **Harmony and Proportion:** The goal is to create a result that enhances the patient's natural beauty, respecting facial proportions and individual uniqueness.

*   **Long-Lasting Results:** The technique aims to provide results that are maintained over time, delaying the effects of aging.

*   **Optimized Recovery:** The minimally invasive approach contributes to a faster and more comfortable recovery for the patient.

---

## Why is Direct Vision a Differential?

Direct Vision, one of the pillars of the Modern Face philosophy, offers several advantages over the endoscopic technique:

*   **Greater Precision and Control:** Direct visualization of the area to be treated allows the surgeon to perform the procedure with greater precision and control, minimizing the risk of damage to nerves and blood vessels.

*   **Reduced Dependence on Equipment:** The technique does not require the use of sophisticated and expensive equipment, making it more accessible to a greater number of surgeons and patients.

*   **Faster Recovery:** The minimally invasive approach contributes to a faster and more comfortable recovery for the patient.

### Endoscopy in Frontoplasty: does it still make sense?

Although endoscopy has been a valuable tool in the development of modern facial surgery, Direct Vision Evolutionary Frontoplasty represents a significant advance, offering a safer, more accessible alternative with equally effective results. Dr. Robério Brandão, with his vast experience in both techniques, demonstrates that Direct Vision is the future of Browlift.

## Who is the Ideal Candidate for Evolutionary Frontoplasty?

Evolutionary Frontoplasty is indicated for patients who present:

*   **Eyebrow Droop (Ptosis):** Low eyebrows that give a tired or aged look to the face.

*   **Excess Skin on Upper Eyelid:** Sagging skin covering the upper eyelid, hindering vision and creating a heavy look.

*   **Expression Lines on Forehead:** Wrinkles on the forehead that become more evident with aging.

*   **Eyebrow Asymmetry:** Eyebrows in different positions, creating facial imbalance.

It is important to emphasize that the decision to perform Evolutionary Frontoplasty must be made together with the surgeon, who will evaluate the patient's individual characteristics and their expectations regarding the result.

### Pre-Operative Assessment: what to analyze

Pre-operative assessment is fundamental to determine the most suitable technique and ensure a satisfactory result. The surgeon will evaluate:

*   **Eyebrow Position:** Measure the distance between the eyebrow and the orbital rim to determine the degree of ptosis.

*   **Skin Elasticity:** Evaluate the quality and elasticity of forehead skin to predict the surgery result.

*   **Muscle Contraction:** Analyze the activity of forehead muscles to determine the need for myotomy (muscle weakening).

*   **Patient Expectations:** Understand the patient's expectations regarding the surgery result and align expectations with real possibilities.

## How is Direct Vision Evolutionary Frontoplasty Performed?

Direct Vision Evolutionary Frontoplasty is a surgical procedure involving the following steps:

1.  **Anesthesia:** The procedure is performed under local anesthesia with sedation, providing comfort and safety to the patient.

2.  **Incision:** An incision is made within the scalp, following the hairline.

3.  **Dissection:** Forehead skin is carefully dissected from underlying tissues, allowing access to muscles and structures to be treated.

4.  **Myotomy (Optional):** In some cases, myotomy may be necessary, consisting of weakening forehead muscles responsible for expression wrinkles.

5.  **Repositioning:** Eyebrows are repositioned in a higher and more natural position.

6.  **Fixation:** Eyebrows are fixed in the new position with internal sutures.

7.  **Removal of Excess Skin:** Excess forehead skin is removed, and the incision is closed with sutures.

### The Importance of Anatomy in Frontoplasty

The success of Evolutionary Frontoplasty depends on deep knowledge of facial anatomy. The surgeon must have precise mastery of forehead muscular, nervous, and vascular structures to avoid complications and ensure a natural and long-lasting result. Precise dissection of the temporal region and frontalis muscle, identification and protection of supraorbital and supratrochlear nerves, and understanding of [SMAS](/en/blog/smas-anatomy) anatomy are crucial for a successful result.

## Recovery and Post-Operative Care

Recovery after Evolutionary Frontoplasty is generally fast and smooth. The patient can expect:

*   **Swelling and Bruising:** Swelling and bruising on the forehead and around the eyes are common in the first few days after surgery, disappearing gradually over 1 to 2 weeks.

*   **Numbness:** It is common to feel numbness in the scalp and forehead, which usually disappears in a few weeks or months.

*   **Return to Activities:** Most patients can return to normal activities in about 7 to 10 days.

It is fundamental to follow the surgeon's instructions to ensure proper recovery and optimize the surgery result.

### Essential Care for a Successful Recovery

*   **Rest:** Avoid intense physical activities in the first few weeks after surgery.

*   **Cold Compresses:** Apply cold compresses to the forehead and around the eyes to reduce swelling and bruising.

*   **Head Elevation:** Keep head elevated when sleeping to decrease swelling.

*   **Medication:** Follow medical prescription to control pain and prevent infections.

*   **Sun Protection:** Use sunscreen daily to protect forehead skin and avoid spots.

## Risks and Complications

Like any surgical procedure, Evolutionary Frontoplasty presents some potential risks and complications, such as:

*   **Frontal Nerve Injury:** Injury to the frontal nerve, which can cause weakness or paralysis of forehead muscles.

*   **Eyebrow Asymmetry:** Eyebrows in different positions, creating facial imbalance.

*   **Scalp Numbness:** Prolonged or permanent numbness in the scalp.

*   **Alopecia:** Hair loss around the incision.

*   **Hypertrophic Scar:** Thick and raised scar.

Choosing an experienced and qualified surgeon, with deep knowledge of facial anatomy and surgical techniques, is fundamental to minimizing these risks and ensuring a safe and satisfactory result.
