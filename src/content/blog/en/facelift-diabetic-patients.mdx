## Can Diabetics Get a Facelift?
**Yes, as long as diabetes is well controlled.** Diabetes is not an absolute contraindication,
but requires special care due to impact on healing and infection risk. Techniques that prioritize
safety and vascular preservation, like [Endomidface, are often preferred.
## Criteria for Safe Surgery
### Ideal parameters:
- • **Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c):** &lt; 7%
- • **Fasting glucose:** &lt; 130 mg/dL
- • **No acute complications** in the last 6 months
- • **Regular endocrinological follow-up**
- • **Preserved kidney function**
## Specific Risks
- • **Delayed healing** — slower process
- • **Higher infection risk** — compromised immunity
- • **Microangiopathy** — can affect vascularization
- • **Perioperative decompensation** — surgical stress
## Perioperative Care
### Preoperative
Glycemic optimization, cardiological evaluation, complete exams.
### Intraoperative
Glycemic monitoring, prophylactic antibiotic, atraumatic technique.
### Postoperative
Strict glucose control, infection surveillance, special dressings.
