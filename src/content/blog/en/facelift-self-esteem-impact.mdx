## Self-Esteem and Body Image: A Deep Connection

Self-esteem, or how we value ourselves, is closely linked to our body image, that is, the perception we have of our own body. When body image is positive, self-esteem tends to be high, contributing to greater self-confidence and emotional well-being. However, when body image is negative, self-esteem can be harmed, leading to feelings of inadequacy, anxiety, and even depression.

Signs of facial aging, such as wrinkles, sagging, and volume loss, can negatively affect body image, especially in a society valuing youth and beauty. Feeling uncomfortable with their own appearance, many people turn to aesthetic procedures like facelifts to restore self-confidence and self-esteem.

The plastic surgeon plays a fundamental role in building self-esteem of patients undergoing facelift. Besides mastering surgical techniques, the professional must have sensitivity and empathy to understand expectations and concerns of each individual.

*   **Psychological evaluation:** It is fundamental that surgeon performs pre-operative psychological evaluation to identify possible self-esteem problems, dysmorphia, or unrealistic expectations.
*   **Clear and honest communication:** Surgeon must explain in detail risks and benefits of procedure, as well as realistically expected results.
*   **Post-operative follow-up:** Surgeon must offer attentive and continuous follow-up, assisting patient in adapting to new image and offering emotional support.

## Realistic Expectations: The Path to Satisfaction

One of biggest challenges in plastic surgery is aligning patient expectations with results that can be realistically achieved. It is fundamental that surgeon is transparent and honest, explaining in detail risks and benefits of procedure, as well as expected results.

### Tips for aligning expectations:

*   **Open communication:** Encourage patient to express expectations and concerns, listening attentively to needs and desires.
*   **Imaging exams:** Use imaging exams to show patient how procedure can alter appearance, assisting in visualizing results.
*   **Before and after photos:** Present before and after photos of other patients who underwent same procedure, showing realistic and achievable results.
*   **Limitations:** Make clear that facelift cannot completely reverse aging process, nor transform patient into completely different person.

By managing expectations realistically, surgeon contributes to more satisfactory surgical result and lasting improvement in patient's self-esteem.

Although facelift can bring numerous psychological benefits, it is important to be aware of risks and complications that may arise. Some patients may experience dysmorphia, post-operative depression, or unrealistic expectations regarding results.

*   **Constant dissatisfaction:** Patient is never satisfied with results, even if surgeon considers result successful.
*   **Social isolation:** Patient isolates from friends and family, feeling ashamed or inadequate.

In these cases, it is fundamental to refer patient to mental health professional, such as psychologist or psychiatrist, so they can receive appropriate support and treatment.
