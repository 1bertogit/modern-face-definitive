# Facelift Complications: Prevention, Identification, and Management

The facelift, or rhytidectomy, is a complex surgical procedure intended to rejuvenate the face, restoring contours and attenuating aging signs. Although providing notable results, like every surgical intervention, it is not free of risks and potential complications. This article aims to provide a comprehensive guide on prevention, early identification, and effective management of complications associated with facelifts, empowering surgeons and patients to navigate this process with safety and confidence.

## The Importance of Prevention: The Pillar of Modern Face

In the [Modern Face](/en/blog/modern-face-concept-philosophy) philosophy, prevention of complications is as crucial as technical skill itself. Dr. Robério Brandão, creator of this philosophy, emphasizes that "safety is not an accident, but the result of meticulous planning, deep anatomical knowledge, and respect for each patient's individual limits."

### Proper Patient Selection
Careful selection of facelift candidates is the first step to minimizing risks. Patients with uncontrolled comorbidities, active smoking, or unrealistic expectations should be approached with caution or, in some cases, contraindicated for the procedure.

### Detailed Surgical Planning
Thorough surgical planning, based on precise anatomical evaluation and each patient's specific needs, is fundamental. Understanding facial structure, identifying risk areas, and choosing the most suitable surgical technique are essential elements for a safe and predictable result.

### Mastery of Surgical Technique
Surgeon skill and experience are determining factors in preventing complications. Familiarity with the chosen technique, knowledge of facial anatomy, and ability to handle unforeseen events are crucial to ensuring patient safety.

## Common Complications and Their Prevention Strategies

Below, we detail the most frequent complications associated with facelifts and strategies to mitigate their risks.

### Hematoma
Hematoma, or blood accumulation under the skin, is one of the most common complications after a facelift.

**Prevention:**
- **Meticulous surgical technique:** Minimizing tissue trauma and performing rigorous hemostasis are crucial steps.
- **Blood pressure control:** Keeping patient blood pressure stable during and after surgery reduces bleeding risk.
- **Avoid anticoagulant medications:** Suspending use of medications increasing bleeding risk, such as aspirin and anti-inflammatories, before surgery.

**Management:**
- **Small hematomas:** Cold compresses and rest are generally sufficient.
- **Larger hematomas:** May require surgical drainage to relieve pressure and prevent complications.

### Seroma
Seroma, or accumulation of serous fluid under the skin, is another possible complication.

**Prevention:**
- **Careful surgical technique:** Avoiding dead spaces and performing good tissue approximation.
- **Drains:** Using suction drains can be useful to remove excess fluid and prevent seroma formation.
- **Compressive dressings:** Applying adequate compressive dressings to reduce dead space and promote tissue adhesion.

**Management:**
- **Small seromas:** Can be treated with compression and observation.
- **Larger seromas:** May require needle aspiration to remove fluid.

### Infection
Although rare, infection is a serious complication that can compromise the facelift result.

**Prevention:**
- **Rigorous aseptic technique:** Using sterilized materials and following rigorous hygiene protocols during surgery.
- **Prophylactic antibiotic therapy:** Administering antibiotics before and after surgery can reduce infection risk.
- **Incision care:** Keeping incision clean and dry, following surgeon's instructions.

**Management:**
- **Mild infections:** Can be treated with oral antibiotics and local care.
- **Severe infections:** May require intravenous antibiotics and surgical drainage.

### Nerve Injury
Nerve injury, whether temporary or permanent, is one of the most feared complications in facelifts.

**Prevention:**
- **Deep anatomical knowledge:** Detailed knowledge of facial anatomy, especially nerve pathways, is essential.
- **Careful surgical technique:** Avoiding excessive tissue traction and performing dissection in safe planes.
- **Protection of marginal mandibular nerve:** When performing neck procedures, exercise extreme caution when manipulating the area where the marginal mandibular nerve is located, avoiding traction or excessive cauterization.

**Management:**
- **Temporary injuries:** Observation and physical therapy may be sufficient to promote recovery.
- **Permanent injuries:** May require surgical interventions to restore nerve function.

Dr. Robério Brandão highlights that the Modern Face philosophy, with its emphasis on "direct vision" and deep anatomical knowledge, minimizes nerve injury risk. "In over 1500 facial surgeries performed, we documented a 0% rate of permanent nerve injury," states Dr. Brandão.

### Skin Sensitivity Changes
Changes in skin sensitivity, such as numbness or hypersensitivity, are common after facelifts.

**Prevention:**
- **Careful surgical technique:** Avoiding excessive traction of cutaneous nerves during dissection.
- **Preservation of blood vessels:** Maintaining integrity of blood vessels supplying skin to ensure good nutrition and sensitivity.

**Management:**
- **Numbness:** Usually improves spontaneously in a few weeks or months.
- **Hypersensitivity:** Can be treated with topical or oral medications to relieve pain and discomfort.

## Specific Complication Management in Modern Face

The Modern Face philosophy, with its less invasive approach and focus on safety, requires specific management for some complications.

### Hematoma in Patients with Biostimulators
In patients who have used biostimulators, tissue fibrosis can increase hematoma risk. The [Endomidface](/en/blog/endomidface-complete-guide) technique, which avoids aggressive dissection in fibrosis areas, can reduce this risk.

### Nerve Injury in Deep Neck
In [Deep Neck](/en/blog/deep-neck-complete-guide), proximity of the marginal mandibular nerve requires extreme caution. The Modern Face technique, which avoids submandibular gland manipulation, decreases nerve injury chance.

### Post-Operative Asymmetry
Facial asymmetry can occur due to differences in healing or individual response of each patient. Modern Face advocates detailed surgical planning and precise fixation techniques to minimize this risk.

## What to Expect: Recovery Timeline

Recovery is a journey requiring patience and specific care at each phase. Knowing what to expect helps reduce anxiety and optimize results.

### First 24-48 Hours

This is the most delicate period. It is normal to have:

- **Moderate to intense edema**: swelling is maximum in this period
- **Bruising**: purple spots may appear and are a natural part of healing
- **Controllable discomfort**: pain is generally mild to moderate, controlled with prescribed painkillers
- **Need for absolute rest**: avoid sudden movements and keep head elevated

### First Week (Days 3-7)

From the third day, you will start noticing progressive improvements:

- Edema begins to decrease gradually
- Bruising changes color (purple → green → yellow)
- Stitches and dressings may be removed as per medical advice
- Light activities can be resumed with caution

### Weeks 2-4

Important transition phase:

- Gradual return to social and professional activities
- Residual edema still present but less noticeable
- Result begins to define, although not yet definitive
- Lymphatic drainage massages may be indicated

### Months 1-3

Final result consolidates progressively:

- Tissues settle into their definitive position
- Scars mature and become less visible
- Sensitivity gradually returns to normal
- Final result visible between 3-6 months

> "Patience is fundamental. The final result of a facial procedure can only be evaluated after 6 months when all tissues have stabilized." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## Post-Operative Warning Signs

Knowing warning signs allows early identification of any complication and quick action.

### When to Seek Surgeon Immediately

Some signs require urgent medical evaluation:

- **Active bleeding** that does not stop with light compression for 10-15 minutes
- **Fever** above 38°C (100.4°F), especially if accompanied by chills
- **Intense and sudden pain** not controlled with prescribed medication
- **Abrupt asymmetry** — much larger swelling on one side may indicate hematoma
- **Skin color change** — paleness or darkening in specific areas
- **Purulent discharge** with unpleasant odor

### Normal Signs (Do Not Worry)

These symptoms are expected and do not require concern:

- **Moderate edema** in the first days, especially in the morning
- **Bruising** (purple spots) that change color progressively
- **Tingling or numbness** temporarily in the operated area
- **Pulling sensation** as tissues heal
- **Small temporary asymmetries** due to irregular edema
- **Difficulty smiling** or moving face in the first days

### Safety Protocol

In case of doubt, follow this protocol:

1. **Document** — take photos and note symptoms
2. **Contact** — call the surgeon's team
3. **Do not self-medicate** — avoid non-prescribed medications
4. **Stay calm** — most complications are manageable

> "In Modern Face, every patient receives a direct communication channel for emergencies. Safety is not a luxury, it is a priority." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## Detailed Post-Operative Care

Procedure success depends on both surgical technique and post-operative care.

### First Days: Critical Phase

In this phase, small precautions make a big difference:

- **Elevated rest**: keep head elevated at 30-45° even when sleeping
- **Cold compresses**: apply in the first 48h to reduce edema
- **Strict medication**: follow exactly prescribed schedules
- **Light diet**: prefer soft foods and avoid excessive chewing
- **Abundant hydration**: water helps with tissue recovery

### First Week: Intermediate Care

As healing advances:

- **Careful hygiene**: clean area as directed, without rubbing
- **Avoid sun exposure**: use hat and sunscreen when necessary to go out
- **Gentle facial movements**: avoid exaggerated expressions
- **Adequate sleep**: body recovers mainly during sleep
- **Avoid alcohol and tobacco**: both impair healing

### Weeks 2-4: Gradual Return

Return to activities should be progressive:

- **Light activities**: short walks are allowed
- **Remote work**: can be resumed as comfortable
- **Light makeup**: generally allowed after 2 weeks
- **Moderate exercise**: only with medical clearance
- **Lymphatic drainage**: indicated to accelerate recovery

### What to Avoid

Throughout the recovery period:

- Direct sun exposure on operated areas
- Intense physical activities before clearance
- Alcohol consumption in the first 2 weeks
- Smoking (ideally stop 4 weeks before and after)
- Non-prescribed anti-inflammatories
- Sudden movements with the face
