## Our Mission
The **Modern Face Institute** was founded with a clear mission: democratize access
to advanced facial surgery techniques, training surgeons capable of delivering excellent results
with maximum safety.
## Why We Exist
We identified a gap: traditional techniques are not suitable for modern faces (with
biostimulators, fillers, etc.), but advanced techniques were restricted to few surgeons
with access to expensive equipment or exclusive training.
The Institute solves this by teaching techniques that are:
- • **Accessible** — without expensive equipment dependence
- • **Safe** — developed for fibrosed faces
- • **Replicable** — structured teaching methodology
- • **Effective** — proven results in hundreds of cases
## Our Programs
### Direct Vision Endomidface
Complete technique for facial midface rejuvenation.
### Deep Neck Mastery
Complete cervical rejuvenation without gland removal.
### Browlift & Frontoplasty

### Legacy Combo

## Leadership
The Institute is led by **Dr. Robério Brandão**, surgeon with 18+ years of
experience, 1,500+ facial surgeries, and creator of the Direct Vision Endomidface
techniques. His mission is to share knowledge that took nearly two decades to develop.
