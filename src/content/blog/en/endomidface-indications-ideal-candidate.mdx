# Endomidface: Discover if You Are the Ideal Candidate for This Facelift

Are you thinking about rejuvenating your face and looking for a natural result with quick recovery and minimal scars? **Endomidface**, a technique created by Dr. Robério Brandão, might be the solution you are looking for. But who is the ideal candidate for this type of facelift?

In this article, we will explore in detail the indications for Endomidface, the signs you should observe in your face, and the realistic expectations you need to have. Understand how the **Modern Face** philosophy applies to this procedure and discover if you are ready to take this step towards a younger and more harmonious face.

## What is Endomidface and How Does It Work?

**Endomidface**, or midface lift, is a surgical technique aiming to rejuvenate the central region of the face, elevating cheeks, softening the nasolabial fold, and improving lower eyelid contour.

Created by Dr. Robério Brandão, the technique stands out for being minimally invasive and using a superior access, through a small incision in the scalp, in the temporal region. This approach, known as **Direct Vision**, allows the surgeon to work in the deep plane of the face with precision and safety, without the need for complex equipment like an endoscope.

### Endomidface by Direct Vision: The "Video Without Video"

The **Endomidface by Direct Vision** technique is known as "video without video" for dispensing with the use of an endoscope. Instead of operating through a monitor, the surgeon uses a small incision and delicate instruments to access and reposition facial tissues, guided by their experience and knowledge of anatomy.

### The Modern Face Philosophy

Endomidface is part of the **Modern Face** philosophy, which seeks natural and lasting results, focusing on patient safety and optimizing recovery time. This philosophy is based on three pillars:

1. **Non-Negotiable Safety:** Prioritizing techniques that minimize complication risks.
2. **Elegance in Simplicity:** Seeking sophisticated results with minimally invasive procedures.
3. **Optimized Recovery:** Reducing recovery time and post-operative discomfort.

## Who Can Benefit from Endomidface?

Endomidface is an excellent option for those looking to rejuvenate the midface and presenting the following signs:

*   **Cheek drooping:** Loss of volume and support in malar region causes a tired and aged look.
*   **Nasolabial fold:** The famous "smile lines" become deeper and more evident with time.
*   **Elongated lower eyelid:** Loss of muscle tone and skin sagging cause lower eyelid to stretch, creating a "sad eye" look.
*   **Loss of facial contour definition:** Jawline loses definition and face gains a squarer shape.

### Signs You Might Be a Candidate

If you identify with one or more of the following signs, Endomidface might be a great option for you:

1.  **You feel your face is "droopy" and lacks volume in cheeks.**
2.  **Your lower eyelids seem longer and saggy than before.**
3.  **You notice your face has lost contour and definition.**
4.  **You seek natural rejuvenation, without an "operated look".**
5.  **You want to avoid extensive scars and a long recovery period.**

## Modern Face and Biostimulators: A Smart Combination

In recent years, collagen biostimulators have become very popular for rejuvenating skin and replacing facial volume. However, excessive or inadequate use of these substances can lead to fibrosis formation, which are areas of hardened and scarred tissue under skin.

[Infographic: Image illustrating difference between a face with and without fibrosis caused by biostimulators]

The good news is that Endomidface is a technique that can be performed even in patients who have already had biostimulators. In fact, in many cases, Endomidface is the best option to reverse unwanted effects of fibrosis and restore facial harmony.

### How Does Endomidface Act on Face with Fibrosis?

The Direct Vision technique allows the surgeon to identify and bypass fibrosis areas, repositioning facial tissues safely and effectively. Additionally, Endomidface stimulates natural collagen production, improving skin quality and providing a more lasting result.

## What to Expect from Endomidface: Results and Expectations

Endomidface is a powerful technique, but it is important to have realistic expectations about results. The procedure can:

*   **Lift cheeks and restore facial volume.**
*   **Soften nasolabial fold.**
*   **Improve lower eyelid contour.**
*   **Provide a younger and more rested look.**

However, Endomidface is not indicated to treat:

*   **Jowls:** The technique does not correct jaw sagging.
*   **Excess neck skin:** To treat this area, it is necessary to associate Endomidface with a neck lift.
*   **Fine wrinkles and skin spots:** To improve skin texture and quality, other procedures like peels and lasers may be recommended.

## Detailed Post-Operative Care

Procedure success depends as much on surgical technique as on post-operative care.

### First Days: Critical Phase

In this phase, small cares make big difference:

- **Elevated rest**: keep head elevated at 30-45° even when sleeping
- **Cold compresses**: apply in first 48h to reduce edema
- **Rigorous medication**: follow exactly prescribed schedules
- **Light diet**: prefer soft foods and avoid excessive chewing
- **Abundant hydration**: water helps in tissue recovery

### First Week: Intermediate Care

As healing advances:

- **Careful hygiene**: clean area as directed, without rubbing
- **Avoid sun exposure**: use hat and sunscreen when necessary to go out
- **Gentle facial movements**: avoid exaggerated expressions
- **Adequate sleep**: body recovers mainly during sleep
- **Avoid alcohol and tobacco**: both harm healing

### Weeks 2-4: Gradual Return

Return to activities should be progressive:

- **Light activities**: short walks are allowed
- **Remote work**: can be resumed as per comfort
- **Light makeup**: generally allowed after 2 weeks
- **Moderate exercises**: only with medical clearance
- **Lymphatic drainage**: indicated to accelerate recovery

### What to Avoid

During entire recovery period:

- Direct sun exposure on operated areas
- Intense physical activities before clearance
- Alcohol consumption in first 2 weeks
- Smoking (ideally stop 4 weeks before and after)
- Non-prescribed anti-inflammatories
- Sudden movements with face
