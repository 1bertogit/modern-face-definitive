## What is Malar Ptosis?
**Malar ptosis** is the descent of tissues in the cheekbone region. With aging,
malar fat (which gives volume to the cheekbones) descends due to gravity and weakening of retaining
ligaments, creating a tired and aged appearance.
## Signs of Malar Ptosis
- • "Flattened" or absent cheekbones
- • Deep nasolabial fold
- • Lower eyelid with "bag" or heavy appearance
- • Accentuated tear trough
- • Loss of malar projection when smiling
## Treatment: Endomidface
**Direct Vision Endomidface** is the ideal treatment for malar ptosis, as it vertically
repositions the entire midface unit. Unlike fillers that add volume, Endomidface returns tissues
to their original anatomical position.
