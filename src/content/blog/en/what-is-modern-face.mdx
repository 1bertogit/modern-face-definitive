faq:
  - question: "What is Modern Face?"
    answer: "Modern Face is a surgical philosophy developed by Dr. Robério Brandão that recognizes that most patients seeking facial surgery today (70-90%) have already received treatments with fillers and biostimulators. These substances alter tissue planes, creating fibrosis and adhesions. Modern Face adapts surgical techniques to this contemporary reality, instead of assuming virgin tissue as in classic textbooks."
  - question: "Why is Modern Face different from traditional techniques?"
    answer: "Traditional facelift techniques were developed for patients with virgin tissue — who never received injectables. Modern Face recognizes that this patient is now the exception, not the rule. Classic surgical planes (sub-SMAS, for example) may be altered by granulomas, fibrosis and biostimulator capsules. Modern Face works in more predictable and safer planes for the contemporary patient."
  - question: "What are the three pillars of Modern Face?"
    answer: "The three pillars are: (1) Maximum Safety — absolute prioritization of nerve preservation and complication prevention; (2) Elegance in Results — natural rejuvenation with vertical vectors, without 'pulled' appearance; (3) Optimized Recovery — techniques with less dissection, local anesthesia and faster return to activities."
  - question: "What are biostimulators and how do they affect facial surgery?"
    answer: "Biostimulators are injectable substances (such as Sculptra, Radiesse, Ellansé) that stimulate collagen production. Over time, they can create fibrosis, nodules and changes in anatomical planes. Surgeons who operate without considering this history encounter unpredictable tissues, difficult dissection and higher risk of complications. Modern Face was specifically developed for these patients."
  - question: "Who created the Modern Face philosophy?"
    answer: "Modern Face was developed by Dr. Robério Brandão, Brazilian plastic surgeon from Natal-RN, over more than 18 years of clinical practice and more than 1,500 facial surgeries. He is also the creator of the ENDOMIDFACE by Direct Vision technique and pioneer in facial video-endoscopy in Rio Grande do Norte (2007)."
  - question: "Is Modern Face indicated for all patients?"
    answer: "Modern Face is especially indicated for patients between 45-65 years old who have already received treatments with fillers or biostimulators. For patients over 70 years old with great skin and SMAS redundancy, or patients with completely virgin tissue, other approaches may be more appropriate. Correct patient selection is fundamental."
  - question: "What techniques are part of Modern Face?"
    answer: "The main techniques are: ENDOMIDFACE by Direct Vision (midface elevation), Deep Neck without gland removal (cervical rejuvenation) and evolutionary Frontoplasty/Browlift. All share the principles of direct vision, vertical vectors and maximum safety."
  - question: "What does 'Direct Vision' mean in Modern Face?"
    answer: "Direct Vision means operating by directly visualizing the surgical field with loupes and frontal illumination, without dependence on endoscopic equipment (towers of $100,000-$150,000). This eliminates risks of equipment failure, camera delay and loss of tactile feedback, maintaining total control during surgery."
  - question: "What is the safety record of Modern Face techniques?"
    answer: "Dr. Robério Brandão documented more than 1,500 facial surgeries using Modern Face techniques with zero permanent nerve injuries recorded. This safety record is attributed to the Direct Vision approach, which allows superior anatomical visualization and active protection of noble structures."
  - question: "How can I learn Modern Face techniques?"
    answer: "The Modern Face Institute offers structured mentorship programs with Dr. Robério Brandão himself: ENDOMIDFACE Mentorship (2 months), Deep Neck Mentorship (2 months) and Legacy Combo (complete 6 months). Programs include theoretical classes, live case discussion and continuous follow-up."

## 1. Introduction: The Problem Nobody Talks About
There is a secret that few plastic surgeons publicly admit: **the techniques we learned in residency are becoming obsolete**. Not because anatomy changed — it's been the same for thousands of years. But because *patients* changed.
Think about the last patient you saw seeking facial rejuvenation. What is the
probability they never received a filler? That they never had Sculptra, Radiesse, or any
biostimulator? Of having a face completely virgin of injectables?
If you're honest, the answer is probably: **very low**. Conservative
studies estimate that 70-90% of patients seeking facial surgery have already received
injectable treatments. Some multiple times, over years.
And here's the problem: all classic facial surgery literature — the books by Baker,
Hamra, Mendelson — was written for patients with virgin tissue. Traditional Deep Plane
assumes intact anatomical planes. SMAS-ectomy assumes predictable tissue consistency.
> "We cannot continue operating the Modern Face with techniques developed for the Classic
> Face. The tissue changed. Our approach needs to change with it."
> 
> - — Dr. Robério Brandão, creator of Modern Face®
This article presents **Modern Face®** — a surgical philosophy developed specifically
for this new reality. It's not a single technique, but a complete framework for thinking and
executing facial surgery in the 21st century.

## 2. What Is Modern Face?
**Modern Face®** is a surgical philosophy that recognizes and adapts to the reality
of the contemporary patient. It was developed by [Dr. Robério Brandão over more than 18 years of clinical practice in Natal-RN, Brazil.
The name "Modern Face" is not marketing — it's literal description. It refers to the
face we find today in offices: a face that has been treated, injected, stimulated. A
face that has history, not virgin tissue.
### Technical Definition
The **Modern Face** is characterized by facial tissue that has already received
treatments with fillers (hyaluronic acid, calcium hydroxylapatite) and/or biostimulators
(poly-L-lactic acid, polycaprolactone), resulting in alterations of classic anatomical planes
through fibrosis, encapsulation and induced neocollagenesis.
This has profound surgical implications. The sub-SMAS plane — the one classic Deep Plane
uses — may be completely altered. You may find:
- 
**Granulomas:** Inflammatory nodules around filler particles
- 
**Fibrosis:** Scar tissue that adheres planes that should slide
- 
**Pseudocapsules:** Encapsulation of biostimulators in unpredictable locations
- 
**Irregular neocollagen:** Collagen production in non-anatomical patterns
Modern Face® doesn't ignore this reality — it embraces it. The techniques were developed
to work *despite* these alterations, and in many cases, *because* of them.

## 3. The Three Pillars of Modern Face
Every surgical philosophy needs non-negotiable principles. Modern Face® is sustained by
three pillars that guide every technical decision:

Pillar 1
### Maximum Safety
The preservation of noble structures — especially facial nerve branches — is absolute
priority. There is no aesthetic result that justifies compromising function. Each
technical maneuver of Modern Face was designed with safety as primary requirement, not
secondary consideration.
**In practice:** The registry of 1,500+ surgeries with zero permanent nerve injuries validates this commitment.

Pillar 2
### Elegance in Results
Rejuvenation is not stretching skin. It's repositioning tissue following vectors that
mimic young anatomy. Modern Face uses **vertical vectors** — elevating where
gravity pulls down — instead of the lateral tension of classic techniques that create the
dreaded "pulled look".
**In practice:** Patients look rested and younger, not operated.

Pillar 3
### Optimized Recovery
Minimal dissection means less trauma. Less trauma means less edema. Less edema means
faster recovery. Modern Face techniques allow use of local anesthesia with sedation,
shorter procedures and earlier return to activities — without compromising results.
**In practice:** Many patients return to social activities in 7-10 days.

## 4. Biostimulators: The Silent Change
To understand the need for Modern Face, we need to understand what biostimulators do to
facial tissue — and why this changes everything for the surgeon.
### What Are Biostimulators?
Biostimulators are injectable substances that stimulate collagen production by the
organism itself. The most common include:
- 
• **Poly-L-lactic acid (Sculptra®)** — stimulates gradual neocollagenesis
- 
• **Calcium hydroxylapatite (Radiesse®)** — filling effect + biostimulation
- 
• **Polycaprolactone (Ellansé®)** — biostimulating microspheres in carrier
gel
These treatments are effective for non-surgical rejuvenation. The problem arises when
the patient eventually needs surgery.
### The Surgical Impact
When you inject a biostimulator, you are creating a controlled inflammatory reaction
that produces collagen. But this process also creates:
#### Iatrogenic Fibrosis
Scar tissue that adheres anatomical planes. The sub-SMAS that should slide easily
may be completely adherent.
#### Foreign Body Granulomas
Localized inflammatory reactions around product particles, creating nodules in
unpredictable locations.
#### Pseudocapsules
Fibrous encapsulation of biostimulator deposits that can be confused with anatomical
structures.
#### Altered Planes
Neocollagenesis can create "false planes" that look correct but lead to dangerous
structures.
The surgeon who enters the sub-SMAS plane expecting textbook anatomy may have unpleasant
surprises. Structures that should be at certain depth may be more superficial or deeper.
Vessels and nerves that should be protected by fascial planes may be exposed.
**Modern Face recognizes this and works in safer and more predictable planes** — such as the subperiosteal of the midface, where the presence of biostimulators rarely
affects dissection.

## 5. Modern Face Techniques
Modern Face is not a single technique — it's a set of approaches that share the same
philosophical principles:

### ENDOMIDFACE® by Direct Vision
Midface Region
Midface elevation technique using direct vision (without endoscopy), temporal and
intraoral approach, working in the subperiosteal plane. Ideal for correction of
nasolabial fold, flattened malar and lower eyelid.
Direct Vision
Vertical Vector
Local Anesthesia

### Deep Neck without Gland Removal
Cervical Region
Cervical rejuvenation that addresses platysma, subplatysmal fat and digastric muscle
preserving the submandibular gland. Uses techniques like Platysmaplasty, Digastric
Shaving and Glandular Loop for cervical definition without the risks of gland
removal.
Preserves Gland
Platysmaplasty
Lower Risk

### Evolutionary Frontoplasty / Browlift
Upper Face Region
Brow elevation and frontal rejuvenation following principles of direct vision and
appropriate vectors. Approach that avoids excesses of classic techniques while
restoring natural brow position.
Direct Vision
Natural
Personalized

## 6. Who Created Modern Face?
The Modern Face philosophy was developed by **Dr. Robério Brandão**,
Brazilian plastic surgeon based in Natal, Rio Grande do Norte. With more than 18
years dedicated to facial surgery and more than 1,500 documented procedures, Dr.
Brandão developed Modern Face from clinical necessity, not academic theory.
In 2007, he became a pioneer in facial video-endoscopy in Rio Grande do Norte.
Paradoxically, this experience with endoscopic surgery revealed its limitations —
and pointed the way to the Direct Vision that characterizes all Modern Face
techniques.
His credentials include invited lectures at the National Congress of SBCP (2023) and
Full Face Global Summit (2024), in addition to having trained more than 130 surgeons
from 7+ countries.
