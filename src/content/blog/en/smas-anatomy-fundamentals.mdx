faq:
  - question: "What is SMAS?"
    answer: "SMAS (Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System) is a continuous fibrous layer that connects the facial mimetic muscles to the overlying dermis. It functions as a 'network' that distributes muscular tension to the skin. In facial surgery, the SMAS is frequently used as an anchor point and traction vector."
  - question: "What's the difference between fixed and mobile SMAS?"
    answer: "Mobile SMAS is the portion that can be tractioned and surgically repositioned — primarily located over the parotid and preauricular region. Fixed SMAS is firmly adhered to deep structures by retaining ligaments — mainly over the zygoma and orbicularis. Understanding this distinction is crucial for surgical planning."
  - question: "Why is facial nerve anatomy important?"
    answer: "The facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) controls all facial expression. Injury to any branch causes paralysis of specific muscle groups. The nerve traverses the sub-SMAS plane on its path from the parotid to facial muscles. Every facial surgeon must master this nerve's anatomy to avoid devastating complications."
  - question: "What are the danger zones in facial surgery?"
    answer: "The main danger zones include: (1) Zygomatic arch — superficial temporal branch; (2) Pitanguy's line — temporal branch; (3) Pre-masseteric region — zygomatic and buccal branches; (4) Mandibular margin — marginal mandibular branch; (5) Cervical midline — external laryngeal nerve. Modern Face teaches detailed mapping of these zones."
  - question: "What are retaining ligaments?"
    answer: "Retaining ligaments are fibrous condensations that connect the dermis to deep structures (periosteum, muscular fascia). They include: zygomatic ligament, masseteric ligament, mandibular ligament, and platysma-auricular ligament. They 'hold' tissues in position. Aging weakens these ligaments, causing ptosis."

## What Is the SMAS?
The **SMAS (Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System)** is a continuous fibrous
layer described by Mitz and Peyronie in 1976. It connects the facial mimetic muscles to the
overlying dermis, functioning as an interface between deep and superficial structures.
Conceptually, the SMAS can be understood as a facial extension of the cervical platysma.
It is continuous with:
- • **Superiorly:** Galea aponeurotica (scalp)
- • **Inferiorly:** Platysma (neck)
- • **Laterally:** Parotid-masseteric fascia
- • **Medially:** Facial mimetic muscles
### 💡 Clinical Implication
Being continuous and integrated with mimetic muscles, the SMAS transmits muscular
forces to the skin — it's what creates facial expressions. When we traction the SMAS
surgically, we're moving not just a passive layer, but an entire functional unit.

## Fixed SMAS vs Mobile SMAS
This distinction, popularized by Mendelson, is fundamental for surgical planning:
### Mobile SMAS
Portion that can be tractioned and repositioned. Primarily located:
- • Over the parotid gland
- • Preauricular region
- • Lateral cheek portion
**Surgery:** This is the portion used for plication, SMAS-ectomy and traction
in Deep Plane.
### Fixed SMAS
Portion firmly adhered to deep structures by retaining ligaments. Primarily located:
- • Over the zygomatic arch
- • Orbicularis oculi region
- • Parotid-cutaneous line
**Surgery:** Must be released to allow mobilization. Retaining ligaments
need to be sectioned.
In the context of [Modern Face, this distinction has additional implications: biostimulators often create fibrosis in
the mobile SMAS, making sub-SMAS dissection unpredictable. The subperiosteal plane (used
in Endomidface) avoids this problem.

## Danger Zones: Facial Nerve Mapping
The facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) is the most important structure to protect in any
facial surgery. Its injury causes motor paralysis with devastating aesthetic and
functional consequences.
### Basic Facial Nerve Anatomy
The facial nerve emerges from the stylomastoid foramen, traverses the parotid and
divides into five main branches (mnemonic: **Two Zebras Bit My Cookie**):

**1. Temporal (frontal):** Frontal muscle, superior orbicularis
**2. Zygomatic:** Orbicularis oculi, lip elevators
**3. Buccal:** Buccinator, orbicularis oris, nasals
**4. Marginal mandibular:** Lower lip depressors
**5. Cervical:** Platysma

## Retaining Ligaments: The Key to Facial Ptosis
Retaining ligaments are fibrous condensations that anchor the dermis to deep structures.
With aging, they weaken, allowing tissues to "fall" — facial ptosis.
### Main Retaining Ligaments
#### Zygomatic Ligament
From zygomatic arch to malar dermis. Its attenuation causes malar ptosis and
deepening of the nasolabial fold. Release necessary in Endomidface.
#### Masseteric Ligament
From anterior masseter border to dermis. Contributes to jowl formation when
weakened.
#### Mandibular Ligament
From mandibular border to dermis. Last support before jowl descends over the
mandible.
#### Platysma-Auricular Ligament
From platysma to auricular region. Important for lateral cervical stability.
#### 🔑 Practical Application — Modern Face
In **Endomidface**, the zygomatic ligament and orbicularis retaining
ligament (ORL) are specifically released to allow vertical elevation of the malar fat
pad. In **Deep Neck**, cervical ligaments are addressed for contour
redefinition. The mentorship](/en/blog/what-is-modern-face) teaches
safe release of each ligament.
