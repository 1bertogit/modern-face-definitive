faq:
  - question: "What is the most common facelift complication?"
    answer: "Hematoma is the most frequent complication, occurring in 2-8% of cases. It's more common in men and hypertensive patients. Most are small and resolve spontaneously; large hematomas require surgical drainage."
  - question: "Is facial nerve injury common?"
    answer: "Permanent injury is rare (&lt;1% in experienced hands). Temporary weakness from neuropraxia (stretching) is more common (2-5%) and resolves within weeks to months. The most vulnerable branch is the marginal mandibular."
  - question: "How to prevent hematoma?"
    answer: "Rigorous perioperative BP control, suspension of anticoagulants/NSAIDs, meticulous hemostatic technique, use of drains when indicated, and postoperative instructions about rest and avoiding effort."
  - question: "Does skin necrosis happen?"
    answer: "It's rare (&lt;1%) with adequate technique. Risk factors include smoking, excessive skin tension, undrained hematoma, and diabetes. When it occurs, usually in pre-auricular areas. Treatment is conservative in most cases."
  - question: "Is infection frequent in facelift?"
    answer: "No, the face has excellent vascularization. Infection occurs in &lt;1% of cases. Antibiotic prophylaxis further reduces risk. When it occurs, usually responds well to antibiotics."
  - question: "What is 'pixie ear' and how to avoid it?"
    answer: "Pixie ear is earlobe distortion from excessive tension. Occurs when skin is closed under tension in the auricular region. Prevention: close without tension, with SMAS support."
  - question: "Can asymmetry occur after facelift?"
    answer: "Mild asymmetry is common and usually existed before (faces are not perfectly symmetrical). Significant new asymmetry may indicate nerve injury or asymmetric technique. Careful evaluation and, if necessary, revision."
  - question: "How long does it take for complications to appear?"
    answer: "Hematoma: first 24-48h. Infection: 3-7 days. Necrosis: 3-10 days. Nerve injury: immediate or within first days. Abnormal scars: weeks to months. That's why postoperative follow-up is essential."

## The Importance of Knowing Complications
No surgery is risk-free. Facelift, despite being a safe procedure when well executed,
has potential complications that every surgeon must know deeply — not to fear, but to **prevent, identify early and treat properly**.
The [Modern Face philosophy has as its first pillar **Maximum Safety**. This doesn't mean
absence of risks, but rather minimization through refined technique, adequate patient
selection and rigorous protocols.

## Hematoma: The Most Common Complication
Hematoma is blood accumulation in the dissection space. It's the most frequent
complication of facelift, occurring in 2-8% of cases in the literature.
### Risk Factors
- • Male gender (2-3x more common)
- • Arterial hypertension
- • Use of anticoagulants/NSAIDs
- • Cough, vomiting, effort in post-op
- • Inadequate hemostatic technique
### Prevention
- • BP &lt;140/90 in perioperative period
- • Suspend ASA/NSAIDs 7-10 days before
- • Meticulous hemostasis
- • Drains when indicated
- • Prophylactic antiemetics
### Hematoma Management
#### Small Hematoma (&lt;50ml)
Observation, gentle compression, BP control. Usually resolves with spontaneous
absorption.
#### Large/Expanding Hematoma
SURGICAL EMERGENCY. Return to operating room for drainage and hemostasis. Delay
increases skin necrosis risk.

## Nerve Injury: The Greatest Fear
Facial nerve injury is the greatest fear of patients and surgeons. Fortunately,
permanent injury is rare in experienced hands (&lt;1%). Temporary weakness from
neuropraxia is more common but resolves.
### Branches at Risk
#### Marginal Mandibular Branch
Most vulnerable. Innervates lower lip depressors. Injury causes smile asymmetry.
Crosses mandible ~2cm posterior to angle.
#### Temporal (Frontal) Branch
Risk in browlift. Innervates frontalis muscle. Injury causes inability to raise
eyebrow. Crosses zygomatic arch.
#### Buccal Branch
Multiple anastomoses - isolated injury rarely causes permanent deficit. Innervates
perioral musculature.
#### Great Auricular
Sensory (not motor). Injury causes earlobe numbness. Very superficial in cervical
region - easy to injure if inattentive.
#### 💡 Modern Face Advantage
The Endomidface technique works in the subperiosteal plane, BELOW the facial nerve branches. This virtually
eliminates the risk of injury to motor branches during midface dissection.

## Skin Necrosis
Skin necrosis is rare (&lt;1%) but devastating when it occurs. Results from ischemia due
to excessive tension, compressive hematoma or vascular compromise.
### ⚠️ Risk Factors
- • **Smoking** (main factor)
- • Excessive closure tension
- • Undrained hematoma
- • Poorly controlled diabetes
- • Very superficial dissection
- • Reoperation (previous scar)
### ✅ Prevention
- • Cease smoking 4-6 weeks
- • Close skin WITHOUT tension
- • Tension on SMAS, not skin
- • Drain hematomas promptly
- • Adequate dissection plane

## Summary: Prevention Pillars
1.
#### Rigorous Patient Selection
Identify and modify risk factors. Refuse when indicated.
2.
#### Deep Anatomical Knowledge
Know where structures at risk are. Don't improvise.
3.
#### Meticulous Technique
Hemostasis, correct planes, tension-free closure.
4.
#### Close Follow-up
Early identification allows intervention before complication worsens.
