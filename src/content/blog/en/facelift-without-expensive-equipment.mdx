faq:
  - question: "Is it possible to perform quality facelift without expensive equipment?"
    answer: "Yes. Endomidface by Direct Vision uses only conventional surgical instruments, without need for video towers, endoscopes or special equipment, delivering excellent results."
  - question: "How much does video-endoscopy tower cost?"
    answer: "Complete tower for facial surgery can cost $80,000 to $200,000, plus annual maintenance costs and camera replacement. This limits access to many surgeons."
  - question: "Does result quality depend on equipment?"
    answer: "Not necessarily. Quality depends on technique, anatomical knowledge and surgeon skill. Equipment is tool — direct vision can be superior to video-endoscopy in many cases."
  - question: "Why does direct vision dispense special equipment?"
    answer: "Because surgeon directly visualizes structures through strategic accesses, using own eyes and conventional lighting, without camera and monitor intermediation."

## The Equipment Myth
There's belief that excellent facial surgery results require heavy technology investments.
Video-endoscopy towers, 4K cameras, special lighting systems — all can cost hundreds of
thousands of dollars.
Truth is **equipment doesn't operate**. Surgeon operates. And best
"technology" remains human eye combined with skilled hands and deep anatomical knowledge.

## Cost of Technology Dependence
### 💰 Endoscopic Equipment Investment
- • **Complete video tower:** $80,000 - $200,000
- • **Facial endoscopes:** $15,000 - $40,000 each
- • **Annual maintenance:** $10,000 - $25,000
- • **Camera replacement:** $30,000 - $60,000
- • **Depreciation time:** 5-7 years
Total in 5 years: $150,000 - $400,000+
This investment creates significant entry barrier, limiting advanced technique access to
few centers. Additionally, creates dependence — if equipment fails, surgery stops.
## Alternative: Direct Vision
[Endomidface by Direct Vision represents different philosophy: use surgeon's natural ability to see and feel, enhanced by
strategic accesses and adequate lighting.
### ✓ What you need for Endomidface
- • Frontal light or adequate room lighting
- • Conventional dissection instruments
- • Appropriate retractors
- • Standard suture material
- • **Technical knowledge** (most important)
Additional investment: practically zero if you already operate

## Knowledge Democratization
Greatest advantage of Direct Vision technique isn't just economic — it's **access democratization**. Any well-trained surgeon can execute technique in any adequate surgical center.
### This means:
- • More surgeons can offer excellent results
- • Patients in more regions have access to advanced techniques
- • Focus returns to where it should: knowledge and skill
- • Fewer barriers to starting facelift practice
