# Modern Face: The Philosophy That Revolutionized Facial Surgery

Facial surgery, once focused on complex and invasive techniques, is undergoing a transformation. At the heart of this change lies the **Modern Face** philosophy, conceived by renowned plastic surgeon Dr. Robério Brandão. This innovative approach redefines facial rejuvenation standards, prioritizing patient safety, result naturalness, and recovery process optimization.

With over 18 years of experience and more than 1,500 facial surgeries performed, Dr. Robério Brandão developed Modern Face as a response to the limitations of traditional techniques, adapting them to the reality of the contemporary face, marked by the increasing use of biostimulators and expectations for more natural and less invasive results.

Modern Face is not just a set of surgical techniques, but rather a philosophy guiding every decision, from initial patient assessment to surgical planning and post-operative follow-up. It seeks to integrate profound anatomical knowledge, surgical mastery, and cutting-edge technology to offer exceptional results with minimal risks and maximum patient satisfaction.

## The Three Pillars of Modern Face: The Foundation of an Innovative Approach

Modern Face stands on three fundamental pillars, guiding every stage of the surgical process:

1.  **Non-Negotiable Safety:** Patient safety is the top priority. All techniques and procedures are carefully evaluated and adapted to minimize risks and ensure patient integrity. Modern Face seeks to offer predictable and safe results, focusing on avoiding complications and preserving patient health.
2.  **Elegance in Simplicity:** Modern Face values result naturalness and facial harmony. Surgical techniques are refined to achieve subtle and elegant rejuvenation, without the artificial or "stretched" look that can be associated with some traditional approaches. The philosophy seeks to enhance each patient's individual beauty, respecting their unique characteristics and providing a result that looks natural and authentic.
3.  **Optimized Recovery:** Modern Face cares about patient well-being in all phases of the process, including the recovery period. Surgical techniques are designed to minimize tissue trauma and recovery time, allowing the patient to return to normal activities as quickly as possible and with minimal discomfort.

## Endomidface by Direct Vision: The Technique Defining Modern Face

One of the most emblematic techniques of Modern Face is **Endomidface by Direct Vision**, an innovative procedure for midface rejuvenation. Developed by Dr. Robério Brandão, Endomidface by Direct Vision offers a safe and effective alternative to traditional techniques, minimally invasive and with natural and long-lasting results.

### What Is Endomidface by Direct Vision?

Endomidface by Direct Vision is a surgical technique aimed at lifting and repositioning midface tissues, including cheeks and the malar region. Unlike traditional techniques, which often involve extensive incisions and broad dissections, Endomidface by Direct Vision is performed through small incisions in the temporal region, allowing access to the deep facial plane without needing to detach large areas of skin.

The main distinguishing feature of Endomidface by Direct Vision is the use of a "video-less" approach, where the surgeon directly visualizes anatomical structures through incisions, without the aid of an endoscope. This technique requires deep facial anatomy knowledge and refined surgical skill, but offers several advantages over traditional endoscopy, including greater precision, lower complication risk, and faster recovery.

### How Does Endomidface by Direct Vision Fit into Modern Face?

Endomidface by Direct Vision aligns perfectly with the three pillars of Modern Face:

*   **Non-Negotiable Safety:** By avoiding dissection of large skin and soft tissue areas, Endomidface by Direct Vision minimizes the risk of complications such as hematomas, infections, and nerve injuries. The technique is also particularly suitable for patients who have already undergone other facial aesthetic procedures, such as fillers or thread lifts, as it allows avoiding areas of fibrosis or adhesions.
*   **Elegance in Simplicity:** Endomidface by Direct Vision provides natural and harmonious results, without the artificial or "stretched" look that can be associated with some facelift techniques. The technique allows precise repositioning of facial tissues, restoring volume and contour lost with aging, while preserving the patient's expressiveness and individuality.
*   **Optimized Recovery:** Endomidface by Direct Vision is a minimally invasive procedure, meaning recovery time is generally shorter and more comfortable than traditional techniques. Patients can return to normal activities in a few days, with minimal swelling and discomfort.

## Deep Neck: Redefining Cervical Contour in Modern Face

Another fundamental technique in the Modern Face philosophy is **Deep Neck**, a surgical procedure aimed at redefining cervical contour and improving neck appearance. Unlike traditional techniques, which focus mainly on removing skin and superficial fat, Deep Neck addresses deep neck structures, including muscles, glands, and fasciae.

### How Deep Neck Transforms the Neck

Deep Neck is a surgical technique aimed at redefining cervical contour and improving neck appearance. Unlike traditional techniques, which focus mainly on removing skin and superficial fat, Deep Neck addresses deep neck structures, including muscles, glands, and fasciae.

*   **Jawline Definition:** By removing excess fat and repositioning neck muscles, Deep Neck helps define the jawline, creating a younger and more elegant contour.
*   **Double Chin Reduction:** Deep Neck can also be used to reduce double chin, removing excess fat and tissue under the chin.
*   **Cervicomental Angle Improvement:** Deep Neck helps improve the angle between neck and chin, creating a more elongated and slender appearance.

### The Importance of Deep Neck in Modern Face Philosophy

Deep Neck integrates into the Modern Face philosophy for its ability to provide lasting and natural results, respecting neck anatomy and physiology. Unlike older techniques, which often result in an artificial or "stretched" look, Deep Neck seeks to restore the natural neck contour, creating a younger and more harmonious appearance.

## The Future of Facial Surgery: A Patient-Centered Approach

The Modern Face philosophy represents a new era in facial surgery, where safety, naturalness, and patient well-being are placed first. By combining innovative surgical techniques with profound facial anatomy knowledge and a patient-centered approach, Dr. Robério Brandão is transforming how plastic surgeons approach facial rejuvenation.

Modern Face is not just about the quest for youth, but about restoring the harmony and natural beauty of each individual, allowing patients to feel more confident and happy with their appearance.

## Relevant Anatomy for This Procedure

Anatomical knowledge is fundamental to understand how results are achieved safely and effectively.

### Key Structures

The face is composed of layers that must be understood together:

- **Skin**: most superficial layer, reflecting aging through wrinkles and laxity
- **Subcutaneous tissue**: contains fat that redistributes with age
- **SMAS (Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System)**: fundamental layer connecting muscles to skin
- **Facial muscles**: responsible for expression and dynamic support
- **Retaining ligaments**: anchor skin to facial skeleton
- **Facial nerves**: control movement and sensitivity

### Surgical Planes

In Modern Face philosophy, we work in specific planes:

- **Superficial plane**: above SMAS, used in less invasive procedures
- **Deep plane (sub-SMAS)**: below SMAS, allows more lasting results
- **Subcutaneous plane**: used for fat grafting and fat treatment

### Why This Matters

Understanding anatomy explains:

- Why certain procedures last longer than others
- How natural results are achieved
- Why surgeon experience is crucial
- How complications can be avoided

> "Respect for anatomy is what separates a natural result from an artificial one. In Modern Face, each structure has its role and must be preserved or repositioned with precision." — Dr. Robério Brandão
