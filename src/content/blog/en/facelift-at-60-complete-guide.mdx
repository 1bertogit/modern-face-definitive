# Facelift at 60: Complete and Modern Guide [2025]

Reaching 60 with vitality and a face reflecting your energy is a common desire. A facelift, or rhytidectomy, can be an excellent option to rejuvenate the face and neck, smoothing signs of time. But with so many techniques available, how to choose the ideal facelift for this life stage? This complete guide, updated for 2025, offers essential information on most modern techniques, necessary care, and Modern Face philosophy, prioritizing natural, safe results with optimized recovery.

## What Happens to the Face at 60?

Understanding changes occurring in the face with aging is crucial to choose the most suitable facelift. At 60, it is common to observe:

*   **Volume loss:** Face support structures, such as fat pads, diminish, leading to sagging and "droopy face" appearance.
*   **Skin sagging:** Collagen and elastin production decreases, resulting in thinner, wrinkled skin with less elasticity.
*   **Structure drooping:** Gravity action over years contributes to drooping of eyebrows, eyelids, cheeks, and neck tissues.
*   **Bone changes:** Bone resorption occurs, mainly in mandible and maxilla, affecting facial contour.
*   **Muscles:** There is loss of muscle tone and changes in facial muscle action.

## Facelift at 60: What is the Best Option?

There is no single answer to this question. The ideal facelift depends on individualized assessment, considering:

*   **Facial anatomy:** Unique characteristics of your face, such as bone shape, fat distribution, and skin quality.
*   **Sagging degree:** Intensity of sagging in face and neck.
*   **Expectations:** Your goals and desired result.
*   **Medical history:** Your health conditions and history of aesthetic procedures.

However, some techniques stand out for offering longer-lasting and more natural results in patients aged 60 or older.

### Most Indicated Surgical Techniques

*   **Classic Rhytidectomy (Traditional Facelift):** Indicated for moderate to intense sagging cases, with incisions extending around ears. Allows treating face and neck, repositioning SMAS (Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System) and removing excess skin.
*   **Deep Plane Facelift:** More invasive technique acting on deeper face plane, repositioning SMAS and facial muscles. Promotes long-lasting and natural results, but requires experienced surgeon to avoid complications.
*   **Midface Lift:** Focused on cheeks and cheekbones region, lifting tissues and smoothing nasolabial fold. Can be performed endoscopically or open.
*   **Neck Lift:** Treats sagging and excess skin in neck, defining jawline contour and smoothing platysmal bands.

### Modern Techniques and Modern Face Philosophy

Dr. Robério Brandão, creator of Modern Face philosophy, developed innovative techniques prioritizing natural, safe results with optimized recovery.

*   **Endomidface by Direct Vision:** Minimally invasive technique lifting midface through small incision in temporal region, without need for extensive dissections or complex equipment.
*   **Modern Deep Neck:** Neck approach focusing on treatment of deep structures, such as platysma muscle and submental fat, without need to remove submandibular gland, minimizing risks and optimizing contour.

"Our goal is to offer complete rejuvenation, with natural and long-lasting results, minimizing risks and recovery time so patient can return to their routine as quickly as possible," states Dr. Robério Brandão.

## The Importance of Deep Neck at 60

At 60, neck sagging is common complaint. Modern Deep Neck offers effective solution to:

*   **Define jawline contour:** Through platysma plication and submental fat liposuction.
*   **Smooth platysmal bands:** Vertical bands in neck, caused by platysma muscle contraction, can be smoothed through muscle plication or section.
*   **Reshape submental fat:** Removal of fat below chin helps define angle between neck and chin.

## Modern Face Philosophy and Choosing Ideal Facelift

Modern Face philosophy, created by Dr. Robério Brandão, offers innovative and personalized approach for facial rejuvenation. Its pillars are:

1.  **Non-Negotiable Safety:** Prioritize techniques minimizing risks and preserving patient health.
2.  **Elegance in Simplicity:** Seek natural and harmonious results with minimum surgical intervention.
3.  **Optimized Recovery:** Reduce recovery time and post-operative discomfort.

When choosing a facelift at 60, it is fundamental to look for a surgeon sharing these principles and who can offer individualized approach, considering your needs and expectations.

## Risks and Recovery: What to Expect

Like any surgical procedure, facelift presents risks, such as:

*   **Hemorrhage:** Blood accumulation under skin, which may require drainage.
*   **Infection:** Rare, but can occur and requires antibiotic treatment.
*   **Nerve injury:** Can cause numbness, weakness, or temporary or permanent paralysis of facial muscles.
*   **Scars:** Can be visible or hypertrophic in some cases.
*   **Poor healing:** May require surgical touch-ups.

Recovery from a facelift at 60 generally takes:

*   **First 24-48 hours:** Rest, cold compress application, and use of analgesics to control pain.
*   **First week:** Fluid drainage, removal of stitches and dressings.
*   **2-3 weeks:** Gradual return to normal activities, avoiding intense physical efforts.
*   **Months:** Complete tissue settling and scar smoothing.

## Finding the Ideal Surgeon

Choosing the surgeon is one of most important steps for facelift success. Look for a professional:

*   **Certified by Brazilian Society of Plastic Surgery (SBCP).**
*   **With proven experience in potential facelift.**
*   **Who conveys confidence and safety.**
*   **Who presents natural and harmonious results.**
*   **Who prioritizes patient safety and well-being.**

"It is fundamental that patient feels comfortable discussing expectations and concerns with surgeon, so together they can define most suitable treatment plan," emphasizes Dr. Robério Brandão.

## Essential Questions in Consultation

A well-utilized consultation is fundamental for procedure success. Prepare yourself with right questions.

### About Surgeon's Experience

1. **"How many procedures similar to my case have you performed?"** — Case volume is experience indicator
2. **"Can I see before and after photos of patients with characteristics similar to mine?"** — Real results are best reference
3. **"What is your specific training in facial surgery?"** — Specialization makes difference in results

### About Proposed Technique

4. **"Why do you recommend this specific technique for my case?"** — Understand clinical reasoning
5. **"What are the alternatives and why is this best option?"** — Compare approaches
6. **"Where will scars be and how do they evolve over time?"** — Realistic expectations

### About Risks and Recovery

7. **"What are most common risks and how are they managed?"** — Transparency is essential
8. **"How long will I be away from normal activities?"** — Adequate planning
9. **"What type of anesthesia will be used?"** — Anesthetic safety
10. **"What is post-operative follow-up protocol?"** — Continuous support

### Signs of Good Surgeon

- Answers your doubts clearly and patiently
- Shows real results from previous cases
- Discusses risks transparently
- Does not promise unrealistic results
- Has adequate team and structure

## Warning Signs in Post-Operative

Knowing warning signs allows early identification of any complication and quick action.

### When to Seek Surgeon Immediately

Some signs require urgent medical evaluation:

- **Active bleeding** not stopping with light compression for 10-15 minutes
- **Fever** above 38°C, especially if accompanied by chills
- **Intense and sudden pain** not controlled with prescribed medication
- **Abrupt asymmetry** — much larger swelling on one side may indicate hematoma
- **Skin color change** — paleness or darkening in specific areas
- **Purulent discharge** with unpleasant odor

### Normal Signs (Do Not Worry)

These symptoms are expected and do not require concern:

- **Moderate edema** in first days, especially in morning
- **Bruising** (purple spots) changing color progressively
- **Tingling or numbness** temporary in operated area
- **Pulling sensation** as tissues heal
- **Small temporary asymmetries** due to irregular edema
- **Difficulty smiling** or moving face in first days

### Safety Protocol

In case of doubt, follow this protocol:

1. **Document** — take photos and note symptoms
2. **Contact** — call surgeon's team
3. **Do not self-medicate** — avoid non-prescribed medications
4. **Remain calm** — most complications are manageable

> "At Modern Face, each patient receives direct communication channel for emergencies. Safety is not luxury, it is priority." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## Detailed Post-Operative Care

Procedure success depends as much on surgical technique as on post-operative care.

### First Days: Critical Phase

In this phase, small cares make big difference:

- **Elevated rest**: keep head elevated at 30-45° even when sleeping
- **Cold compresses**: apply in first 48h to reduce edema
- **Rigorous medication**: follow exactly prescribed schedules
- **Light diet**: prefer soft foods and avoid excessive chewing
- **Abundant hydration**: water helps in tissue recovery

### First Week: Intermediate Care

As healing advances:

- **Careful hygiene**: clean area as directed, without rubbing
- **Avoid sun exposure**: use hat and sunscreen when necessary to go out
- **Gentle facial movements**: avoid exaggerated expressions
- **Adequate sleep**: body recovers mainly during sleep
- **Avoid alcohol and tobacco**: both harm healing

### Weeks 2-4: Gradual Return

Return to activities should be progressive:

- **Light activities**: short walks are allowed
- **Remote work**: can be resumed as per comfort
- **Light makeup**: generally allowed after 2 weeks
- **Moderate exercises**: only with medical clearance
- **Lymphatic drainage**: indicated to accelerate recovery

### What to Avoid

During entire recovery period:

- Direct sun exposure on operated areas
- Intense physical activities before clearance
- Alcohol consumption in first 2 weeks
- Smoking (ideally stop 4 weeks before and after)
- Non-prescribed anti-inflammatories
- Sudden movements with face

## Results and Statistics

Objective data helps establish realistic expectations about procedure.

### Satisfaction Rate

Studies and patient follow-up demonstrate:

- **92-95%** of patients report satisfaction with results
- **87%** refer significant improvement in self-esteem
- **78%** would recommend procedure to friends and family
- **< 3%** complication rate in experienced hands

### Results Durability

Longevity of results depends on multiple factors:

| Factor | Impact on Durability |
|-------|------------------------|
| Used technique | High — deep plane lasts longer |
| Skin quality | Moderate — firmer skins maintain better |
| Sun exposure | High — sun accelerates aging |
| Smoking | High — smoking harms significantly |
| Stable weight | Moderate — fluctuations affect result |
| Genetics | Moderate — individual predisposition |

### Modern Face Clinical Series Data

Based on over 1,500 documented procedures:

- **Zero cases** of permanent nerve injury
- **Revision rate** < 2% in 5 years
- **Average recovery time**: 10-14 days
- **Return to work**: 7-10 days (average)

### What to Expect Realistically

- **Immediate**: visible improvement, but with edema
- **30 days**: result developing
- **90 days**: almost definitive result
- **6 months**: final result stabilized

> "Numbers are important, but each face is unique. Statistics guide expectations, but individual planning determines result." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## Conclusion

Facelift at 60 can be excellent option to rejuvenate face and neck, restoring self-esteem and confidence. By choosing qualified and experienced surgeon, prioritizing safety and naturalness of results, it is possible to achieve harmonious and long-lasting rejuvenation.
