## Ecchymosis vs Hematoma
**Ecchymosis** (superficial bruising) is expected and resolves in 1-2 weeks. **Hematoma** is a collection of blood that forms volume, can cause pain, and sometimes requires drainage.
## Risk Factors
- • Poorly controlled hypertension
- • Use of anticoagulants/antiplatelets
- • Supplements (omega-3, vitamin E, ginkgo)
- • Early physical effort
- • Post-anesthesia nausea/vomiting
- • Surgical technique (inadequate hemostasis)
Advanced techniques like [Endomidface use direct vision to ensure meticulous hemostasis, significantly reducing these risks.
## Prevention
- • Strict blood pressure control
- • Suspension of medications/supplements as guided
- • Absolute rest in first 48h
- • Head elevated while sleeping
- • Avoid effort, bending down, carrying weight
