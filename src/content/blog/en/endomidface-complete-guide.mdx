faq:
  - question: "What is Endomidface?"
    answer: "Endomidface is a midface elevation technique developed by Dr. Robério Brandão. The name comes from 'Endo' (internal) + 'midface', referring to the subperiosteal approach. Important: despite the 'Endo' prefix, it is NOT an endoscopic technique. It uses Direct Vision with surgical loupes and frontal illumination."
  - question: "What's the difference between Endomidface and traditional facelift?"
    answer: "Traditional facelift primarily works on the SMAS with lateral vectors, focusing on jowls and neck. Endomidface works in the subperiosteal plane of the midface with vertical vectors, focusing on the nasolabial fold, malar region, and lower eyelid. They are complementary techniques, not substitutes."
  - question: "Does Endomidface require endoscopic equipment?"
    answer: "No. The technique was specifically developed to NOT depend on endoscopic towers ($100,000-$150,000). It uses surgical loupes, frontal illumination (headlight), and incisions that allow direct vision of the operative field. This eliminates equipment costs, technical failure risks, and the endoscopy learning curve."
  - question: "Who can perform Endomidface?"
    answer: "Plastic surgeons, otolaryngologists, and head and neck surgeons with appropriate training can learn the technique. The Modern Face Institute offers structured mentorship programs with Dr. Robério Brandão. The learning curve is smoother than traditional endoscopic techniques."
  - question: "How long does Endomidface surgery take?"
    answer: "Isolated Endomidface takes approximately 90-120 minutes. When combined with other techniques (Deep Neck, blepharoplasty), total time can vary from 2-4 hours depending on extent. The technique allows use of local anesthesia with sedation in most cases."
  - question: "What are the Endomidface incisions?"
    answer: "The technique uses temporal incision (hidden in the scalp) and, when necessary, intraoral access (upper vestibular). There are no visible facial incisions. Temporal scars are completely hidden in the hair."
  - question: "What is the Endomidface recovery like?"
    answer: "Maximum edema occurs at 48-72h, with significant resolution in 7-10 days. Most patients return to social activities in 10-14 days. Hematomas are rare (&lt;1%) due to controlled dissection technique. Use of hemostatic net eliminates need for drain."
  - question: "Does Endomidface correct nasolabial folds?"
    answer: "Yes, this is one of the main indications. Vertical elevation of the malar fat pad in the subperiosteal plane effectively diminishes the depth of the nasolabial fold by repositioning the malar fat that descended with age."
  - question: "Does Endomidface work on patients with biostimulators?"
    answer: "Yes, and this is one of the great advantages of the technique. The subperiosteal plane is rarely affected by biostimulators, which tend to remain more superficial. The technique was specifically developed considering the 'Modern Face' patient who has already received injectable treatments."
  - question: "What are the risks of Endomidface?"
    answer: "Like any surgery, there are risks of hematoma, infection, and asymmetry. Dr. Brandão's registry of 1,500+ surgeries shows: zero permanent nerve injuries, &lt;2% temporary weakness (complete resolution), &lt;1% significant hematoma. Direct Vision allows active protection of noble structures."

## Introduction: What Is Endomidface?
**ENDOMIDFACE® by Direct Vision** is a midface elevation surgical technique developed
by Dr. Robério Brandão since 2006. The name derives from "Endo" (internal, referring to the
subperiosteal approach) + "midface" (middle third of the face).
### ⚠️ Fundamental Clarification
Despite the "Endo" prefix, Endomidface is **NOT an endoscopic technique**. The name refers to the anatomical approach (internal access to the midface), not to
the use of cameras. The technique uses Direct Vision** — surgical loupes
and frontal illumination — completely eliminating the need for endoscopic towers.
This distinction is critical because it represents the central proposal of the
technique: **achieving superior or equivalent results to traditional endoscopy without the costs,
complexity, and equipment risks**.
### Historical Context
The technique was born from practical necessity. Working in Natal, Brazil, Dr. Brandão
did not have access to the $100,000-$150,000 endoscopic towers that were the standard
for midface surgery at the time. This forced him to develop approaches that achieved the
same objectives with available resources.
In 2007, Dr. Brandão became a pioneer in facial video-endoscopy in Rio Grande do Norte.
Paradoxically, this experience with endoscopic technique validated his suspicions: the
equipment added cost and complexity without necessarily improving results. Direct
vision, when properly optimized, offered equal or superior control.
Over 18 years and more than 1,500 surgeries, the technique was refined to the current
protocol that forms the basis of the [Modern Face Institute training program.

## Anatomical Foundations
Endomidface works in a specific anatomical plane: the **subperiosteal space** of the midface. This is the virtual space between the periosteum (membrane covering the
bone) and the maxillary, zygomatic, and frontal bones.
### Why the Subperiosteal Plane?
- 
**Avascular plane:** Virtually no significant vessels between periosteum
and bone, minimizing bleeding
- 
**Anatomically defined:** Clear boundaries facilitate spatial orientation
during dissection
- 
**Nerve protection:** The facial nerve is superficial to this plane, protected
throughout dissection
- 
**Resistant to biostimulators:** Rarely affected by fibrosis from previous
treatments
### Key Structures
#### Must Preserve
- • Infraorbital nerve (sensation)
- • Temporal branch of facial nerve (motor)
- • Zygomatic branch of facial nerve (motor)
- • Facial artery and vein
#### Must Mobilize
- • Malar fat pad
- • Orbicularis oculi (malar portion)
- • Malar retaining ligaments
- • Periosteum (elevated en bloc)

## Surgical Technique: Step by Step
The following protocol represents the standardized sequence taught at the Modern Face
Institute. Variations may be necessary according to individual anatomy and specific
objectives.

#### 💡 Technical Note: Official Terminology
The Modern Face protocol uses standardized terminology: **Platysmaplasty** (midline platysma suture), Digastric Shaving** (controlled anterior belly
reduction), **Glandular Loop** (repositioning without removal of submandibular
gland). This nomenclature is taught in the mentorship programs.

## Advantages Over Other Techniques
### Endomidface vs Traditional Deep Plane

Midface (malar)
SMAS/jowl/neck

Main vector

Malar ptosis, nasolabial fold
Severe jowl, SMAS redundancy

Modern Face (biostim.)
Excellent
Plane may be altered

**Important:** Endomidface and Deep Plane are not competing techniques — they
are complementary. A patient with significant malar ptosis AND severe jowl can benefit from
both. The question is: *which problem are you solving?*
