# Cervicomental Angle: Anatomy, Assessment, and Modern Face Techniques

A well-defined profile is one of the pillars of facial beauty and youthfulness. And the **cervicomental angle** – the elegant curve defining the transition between chin and neck – plays a crucial role in this harmony.

Understanding anatomy, mastering assessment techniques, and knowing treatment options are essential steps for any professional seeking to offer excellence results in facial surgery.

In this article, Dr. Robério Brandão, creator of Modern Face philosophy, shares his expertise in **restoring ideal cervicomental angle**, combining deep anatomical knowledge with innovative and minimally invasive surgical techniques.

## What Is the Cervicomental Angle?

The cervicomental angle (CMA) is the angle formed by intersection of two imaginary lines:

*   **Line 1:** Drawn from lowest point of mentum (chin) to most anterior point of neck.
*   **Line 2:** Drawn from most anterior point of neck to point where neck meets jaw.

[Image: Diagram illustrating ideal cervicomental angle (105-120 degrees)]

This angle is measured in degrees and reflects curvature between chin and neck.

### Ideal Angle: The Quest for Balance

The ideal cervicomental angle usually sits between **105 and 120 degrees**. This measure provides a well-defined profile, with smooth and elegant transition between chin and neck.

*   **Acute Angle (less than 105 degrees):** May indicate "fat" or "full" neck, with poor jaw definition.
*   **Obtuse Angle (greater than 120 degrees):** May result in "stretched" or "artificial" profile, with unnatural appearance.

---

## Why Is the Cervicomental Angle So Important?

The cervicomental angle is not just an aesthetic measure; it is a fundamental element for facial profile harmony and balance.

A well-defined CMA contributes to:

*   **More Youthful Appearance:** An adequate angle helps create more defined jawline, often associated with youth and vitality.
*   **Facial Contour Improvement:** Cervicomental angle definition enhances facial characteristics, providing more elegant and attractive profile.
*   **Balance and Proportion:** An ideal CMA balances chin size with neck line, avoiding disproportionate or inharmonious appearance.
*   **Impact on Self-Esteem:** Facial profile improvement can have significant impact on patient self-esteem and confidence.

## Anatomy of Cervicomental Angle: Key Structures

To understand how to optimize cervicomental angle, it is crucial to know anatomical structures influencing it:

*   **Submental Fat:** Fat accumulation below chin (double chin) can obscure cervicomental angle, creating rounder and less defined profile.
*   **Platysma Muscle:** This superficial neck muscle can lose tone over time, contributing to flaccidity and loss of angle definition.
*   **Digastric Muscle:** Located below platysma, this muscle can also influence neck contour. Hypertrophied anterior bellies can generate "full neck" aspect.
*   **Cervical Fascia:** Deep cervical fascia, a connective tissue layer enveloping neck structures, can also contribute to lack of angle definition.
*   **Hyoid Bone:** Position of hyoid bone, located in upper neck, has significant impact on cervicomental angle. A lower hyoid can contribute to longer and more elegant neck.
*   **Jaw Bone Anatomy:** Mentum (chin) shape and projection also influence cervicomental angle. Retracted chin can harm profile definition.
*   **Salivary Glands:** Enlarged or ptotic salivary glands can also contribute to cervical contour.

## Cervicomental Angle Assessment: Precise Diagnosis

A complete and precise assessment is fundamental to determine most appropriate treatment for each patient.

### Detailed Physical Exam

Physical exam should include:

*   **Visual Inspection:** Observe neck contour, jaw definition, and presence of double chin.
*   **Palpation:** Evaluate quantity and distribution of submental fat, platysma tone, and hyoid bone position.
*   **Mimicry Assessment:** Observe neck dynamics during speech and swallowing, identifying presence of platysmal bands or abnormal muscle contractions.
*   **Photography:** Record standardized profile and frontal view photographs for documentation and surgical planning.

### Complementary Exams

In some cases, complementary exams can be useful to evaluate deep neck structures:

*   **Ultrasound:** Allows visualizing submental fat, platysma, and digastric muscle, assisting in surgical planning.
*   **CT Scan or MRI:** In complex cases, use these exams to evaluate jaw bone anatomy and hyoid bone position.

### Importance of Dynamics

Cervicomental angle assessment should not be limited to static analysis of patient at rest. It is fundamental to observe neck dynamics during speech, swallowing, and neck flexion.

[Video: Demonstration of cervicomental angle assessment at rest and in motion]

This dynamic assessment allows identifying:

*   **Platysmal Bands:** Vertical cords becoming more prominent during platysma contraction.
*   **Digastric Hypertrophy:** Increased digastric muscle volume, which may be more evident during neck flexion.
*   **Contour Changes:** Neck contour changes during different movements, indicating need for specific treatment of certain structures.

### SPE-M Scoring System

Dr. Robério Brandão developed **SPE-M Scoring System**, an assessment method utilizing **5 measurable criteria** to ensure rigorous patient selection and result predictability.

## Modern Face Techniques to Restore Cervicomental Angle

Modern Face philosophy offers arsenal of innovative techniques to restore ideal cervicomental angle, focusing on natural, long-lasting, and safe results.

### Modern Deep Neck: Structural Base

**Modern Deep Neck** is a set of surgical procedures aiming to redefine neck contour, acting on deep structures below platysma muscle.

Main Modern Deep Neck techniques include:

*   **Submental Liposuction:** Removal of localized fat below chin.
*   **Platysmoplasty:** Suture or plication of platysma muscle to strengthen jawline.
*   **Digastric Myotomy:** Reduction of digastric muscle volume to improve neck contour.
*   **Cervical Fasciotomy:** Release of deep cervical fascia to lengthen neck and define cervicomental angle.
*   **Glandular Loop:** Strategic suture to reposition submandibular gland, without removal, in selected cases.

### Non-Removal of Submandibular Gland Philosophy

One of Modern Face pillars is **preservation of submandibular gland**. Unlike some traditional techniques, Dr. Robério Brandão believes gland removal is not necessary to obtain satisfactory aesthetic result and can increase complication risk.

Instead, Modern Face focuses on:

*   **Redistributing Volume:** Using suture and plication techniques to reposition gland and improve neck contour.
*   **Minimizing Risks:** Avoiding direct gland manipulation, reducing risk of nerve injuries, bleeding, and salivary fistulas.

### Mentoplasty: Harmony and Projection

Mentoplasty, or chin surgery, can be used to increase chin projection and improve cervicomental angle.

Mentoplasty can be performed through:

*   **Chin Implant:** Insertion of silicone prosthesis or other biocompatible material to increase chin volume and projection.
*   **Chin Osteotomy:** Cutting and repositioning chin bone to advance or recede chin.

### Liposuction: Refining Contour

Liposuction can be used to remove excess submental fat and refine cervicomental angle.

Liposuction can be performed alone or in combination with other techniques, such as Deep Neck or mentoplasty.

### Other Complementary Techniques

In some cases, other techniques can be used to complement cervicomental angle treatment:

*   **Botulinum Toxin:** Injection of botulinum toxin into platysma to relax muscle and smooth platysmal bands.
*   **Hyaluronic Acid Filler:** Application of hyaluronic acid filler in jaw region to define contour and improve cervicomental angle.
*   **Radiofrequency:** Use of radiofrequency to stimulate collagen production and improve neck skin firmness.

## Recovery and Results: What to Expect

Recovery after surgery to restore cervicomental angle may vary depending on technique used.

In general, patients can expect:

*   **Swelling and Bruising:** It is common to present swelling and bruising in neck region in first days after surgery.
*   **Discomfort:** There may be discomfort or mild pain, controllled with analgesic medication.
*   **Dressing Use:** Use of compressive dressing is recommended to help reduce swelling and support tissues.
*   **Return to Activities:** Most patients can return to social and professional activities in about 7 to 10 days.

Results of surgery to restore cervicomental angle are generally long-lasting, providing younger, defined, and harmonious profile.

## Anatomy Relevant to This Procedure

Anatomical knowledge is fundamental to understand how results are achieved safely and effectively.

### Key Structures

The face is composed of layers that must be understood together:

- **Skin**: most superficial layer, reflecting aging through wrinkles and sagging
- **Subcutaneous tissue**: contains fat that redistributes with age
- **SMAS (Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System)**: fundamental layer connecting muscles to skin
- **Facial muscles**: responsible for expression and dynamic support
- **Retaining ligaments**: anchor skin to facial skeleton
- **Facial nerves**: control movement and sensitivity

### Surgical Planes

In Modern Face philosophy, we work in specific planes:

- **Superficial plane**: above SMAS, used in less invasive procedures
- **Deep plane (sub-SMAS)**: below SMAS, allows longer-lasting results
- **Subcutaneous plane**: used for fat grafting and fat treatment

### Why This Matters

Understanding anatomy explains:

- Why certain procedures last longer than others
- How natural results are achieved
- Why surgeon's experience is crucial
- How complications can be avoided

> "Respect for anatomy is what separates a natural result from an artificial one. In Modern Face, each structure has its role and must be preserved or repositioned with precision." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## Comparison: Techniques and Approaches

Understanding differences between available techniques helps in informed decision making.
