## Why Standardized Photos?
Cell phone photos in different lighting and angles don't serve for real comparison.
Standardized photos (same lighting, same distance, same angles) are the only objective
method to evaluate results.
## Importance for the Patient
- • See objective change (memory is faulty)
- • Validate investment made
- • Comparison with preoperative expectation
- • Personal historical record
## Importance for the Surgeon
- • Objective result evaluation
- • Learning and continuous improvement
- • Medical-legal documentation
- • Revision planning if necessary
- • Portfolio to guide future patients
