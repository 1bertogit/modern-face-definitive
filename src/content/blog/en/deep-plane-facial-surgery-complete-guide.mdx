# Deep Plane in Facial Surgery: The Definitive Guide for Lasting Results

The **deep plane** in facial surgery represents a milestone in the search for more natural and long-lasting rejuvenation results. Unlike superficial techniques that act only on the skin, dissection in the deep plane allows the repositioning of underlying facial structures, such as the Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System (SMAS), muscles, and fat, providing a more comprehensive improvement and minimizing skin tension.

This complete guide, prepared with the expertise of **Dr. Robério Brandão**, creator of the Modern Face philosophy and the [Endomidface by Direct Vision](/en/blog/endomidface-complete-guide) technique, offers a detailed overview of the deep plane, covering everything from essential anatomy to the most modern and safe surgical techniques. Prepare to elevate your results and master the art of facial rejuvenation!

## What is the Deep Plane and Why is it Essential?

The deep plane, also known as sub-SMAS dissection, is a surgical approach that involves separating the skin and subcutaneous tissue from deeper facial structures, such as the SMAS, muscles, and ligaments. This technique allows the surgeon to reposition these structures individually, correcting sagging and restoring volume lost with aging.

[Image: Illustration comparing superficial and deep dissection of the face, showing SMAS and underlying structures.]

### Advantages of the Deep Plane

*   **More natural results:** By repositioning underlying facial structures, the deep plane avoids the "stretched" or artificial look that can occur with superficial techniques.

*   **Greater durability:** Repositioning deep structures provides longer-lasting results, as it corrects the underlying cause of sagging.

*   **Less skin tension:** By releasing and repositioning the SMAS, the skin can be redraped without excessive traction, resulting in more discreet scars and lower risk of complications.

*   **Comprehensive correction:** The deep plane allows treating different areas of the face in an integrated way, such as cheeks, jawline, and neck, providing a more harmonious rejuvenation.

### Challenges and Risks

Although the deep plane offers numerous advantages, it is fundamental to be aware of the challenges and risks associated with this technique:

*   **Anatomical complexity:** Detailed knowledge of facial anatomy is essential to avoid nerve and vascular injuries.

*   **Learning curve:** Dissection in the deep plane requires experience and surgical skill, as the identification and manipulation of structures can be challenging.

*   **Potential risks:** Nerve injury, bleeding, hematoma, skin necrosis, and contour irregularities are some complications that can occur if the technique is not mastered correctly.

That is why Modern Face, a philosophy created by Dr. Robério Brandão, prioritizes safety and systematization of learning, seeking to reduce risks and optimize results in the deep plane.

## Essential Anatomy for Deep Plane Dissection

Success in deep plane surgery depends on profound knowledge of facial anatomy. It is crucial to master the location and relationship of the following structures:

### Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System (SMAS)

The SMAS is a fibromuscular layer that covers facial muscles and plays a fundamental role in skin support and movement. In deep plane surgery, the SMAS is dissected, released, and repositioned to restore facial contour.

[Image: Detailed SMAS diagram, showing its extension and relationship with facial muscles.]

### Facial Nerves

Facial nerves are responsible for innervating face and neck muscles. Injury to these nerves can result in facial paralysis, asymmetry, and other serious complications. It is fundamental to know the course of the main branches of the facial nerve to avoid injuries during deep plane dissection.

*   **Temporal (frontal) branch:** Innervates forehead and eyebrow muscles.
*   **Zygomatic branches:** Innervate cheek and upper lip muscles.
*   **Marginal mandibular branch:** Innervates lower lip and chin muscles.
*   **Cervical branch:** Innervates platysma muscle in the neck.

### Retaining Ligaments

Retaining ligaments are fibrous structures that connect skin and SMAS to facial skeleton. They provide support and sustenance to facial soft tissues. In deep plane surgery, selective release of these ligaments allows the surgeon to reposition facial tissues more effectively.

*   **Zygomatic ligaments:** Located in cheek region, support SMAS and malar fat.
*   **Masseteric ligaments:** Located in jaw region, support skin and subcutaneous tissue.
*   **Orbital ligaments:** Located around orbit, support lower eyelid and tear trough region.

### Fat Compartments

The face contains several fat compartments that contribute to facial volume and contour. With aging, these compartments can undergo atrophy or ptosis, resulting in volume loss and sagging. In deep plane surgery, the surgeon can reposition or remodel these compartments to restore facial volume and improve contour.

*   **Malar fat:** Located in cheek region, contributes to projection and malar contour.
*   **Suborbicular fat:** Located below orbit, fills tear trough region and softens transition between lower eyelid and cheek.
*   **Buccal fat:** Located in lateral face region, contributes to cheek volume and jaw contour.

## Surgical Techniques in the Deep Plane: The Modern Face Approach

Modern Face, conceived by Dr. Robério Brandão, offers an innovative and safe approach to deep plane surgery, focusing on natural and long-lasting results. The [Endomidface by Direct Vision](/en/blog/endomidface-complete-guide) technique is one of the pillars of this philosophy.

### Endomidface by Direct Vision: The "Video Without Video"

Endomidface by Direct Vision is a minimally invasive technique that allows access to the deep plane through small incisions in the temporal region, without the need for an endoscope. This approach offers several advantages:

*   **Lower risk of nerve injury:** By avoiding excessive tissue manipulation, the technique minimizes risk of facial nerve injury. Dr. Robério's data demonstrate **0% permanent nerve injury** in 212 consecutive Endomidface cases.

*   **Faster recovery:** Smaller incisions and less tissue manipulation result in shorter recovery time and less post-operative discomfort.

*   **Natural results:** Endomidface allows repositioning facial structures individually, providing deeper, more natural, and harmonious results.

*   **Safe access to mobile SMAS:** In patients with history of fillers, the technique avoids area of fibrosis in fixed SMAS, common in other approaches.

### Deep Neck: Harmonizing Cervical Contour

Deep Neck is a surgical technique aimed at improving neck contour, eliminating double chin, defining jawline, and softening neck lines. In Modern Face, Deep Neck is performed with a minimally invasive approach and focus on safety.

*   **Preservation of submandibular gland:** Unlike some traditional techniques, Modern Face Deep Neck avoids removing submandibular gland, minimizing risk of nerve injuries and other complications.

*   **Treatment of deep structures:** The technique concentrates on removing deep fat, treating platysma muscle, and plicating underlying structures, providing longer-lasting and natural result.

*   **Combination with other techniques:** Deep Neck can be combined with Endomidface for complete and harmonious facial rejuvenation.

## Step-by-Step Deep Plane Surgery (Endomidface Technique)

To illustrate practical application of discussed concepts, we present simplified step-by-step Endomidface by Direct Vision technique:

1.  **Marking:** Surgeon marks areas to be treated and course of facial nerves.

2.  **Anesthesia:** Local anesthesia with sedation is performed.

3.  **Incision:** Small incision is made in temporal region, within hairline.

4.  **Dissection:** Surgeon uses delicate instruments to dissect deep plane, separating skin and subcutaneous tissue from SMAS and underlying structures.

5.  **Release:** Retaining ligaments are released to allow mobilization of facial tissues.

6.  **Repositioning:** SMAS and facial structures are repositioned to restore facial volume and contour.

7.  **Fixation:** Tissues are fixed in new position with sutures.

8.  **Closure:** Incision is closed with sutures.

## Safe Navigation in Deep Plane: Knowing Anatomical Landmarks

To operate safely in deep plane, it is essential to know anatomical landmarks guiding surgeon during dissection. Dr. Robério Brandão uses a "Tactile GPS" system based on five fundamental bony landmarks:

1.  **Zygomatic Arch:** Delimits lower region of dissection.
2.  **Orbital Rim:** Defines upper limit of area to be treated.
3.  **Temporal Crest:** Indicates transition between temporal region and forehead.
4.  **Mentum:** Reference for chin projection.
5.  **Mandibular Angle:** Defines jaw contour and lower limit of dissection.

By knowing these landmarks, surgeon can navigate safely in deep plane, avoiding nerve and vascular injuries.
