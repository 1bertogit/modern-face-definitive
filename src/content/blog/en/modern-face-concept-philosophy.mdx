## What is Modern Face?
**Modern Face** is the recognition that faces arriving at the office today are
fundamentally different from faces of 20-30 years ago. The era of biostimulators, fillers, and
multiple previous treatments has created a new anatomy that requires new approaches.
## Why Modern Faces are Different?
- 
• **90% have already used biostimulators** — Sculptra, Radiesse, etc.
- • **Tissue fibrosis** — altered anatomical planes
- • **Filler history** — residual material in tissues
- • **Multiple previous procedures** — threads, ultrasound, laser
- • **Expectation of naturalness** — don't accept "pulled" results
## The Three Pillars
### Maximum Safety
Techniques that protect noble structures even in fibrosed faces
### Elegance in Results
Naturalness above all — look rested, not operated
### Optimized Recovery
Quick return to activities without compromising results
> "We cannot use 1990s techniques on 2025 faces. Modern Face demands modern surgeons."
