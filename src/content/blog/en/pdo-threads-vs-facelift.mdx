The aesthetic medicine market has exploded with minimally invasive options in recent years. Among the most discussed procedures are PDO thread lifts, marketed as "lunchtime facelifts" or "nonsurgical alternatives" to traditional facial surgery. But can a few threads truly replace a comprehensive surgical procedure? More importantly, how do you know which option is right for you?

After performing over 1,500 facial surgeries and consulting with countless patients who've tried threads first, I've developed a clear, evidence-based perspective on this question. The answer isn't about which procedure is "better"—it's about matching the right tool to the right problem. Let me guide you through this decision with data, not marketing hype.

Understanding this distinction isn't just academic. I've seen patients waste thousands of dollars on threads when they needed surgery, and I've also seen patients undergo unnecessary surgery when threads would have sufficed. The goal of this article is to give you the framework to make an informed decision based on your specific anatomy, goals, and life circumstances.

Dr. Robério Brandão has built his practice on transparency and evidence-based decision-making. With zero permanent nerve injuries in 212 documented [Deep Plane facelift](/en/techniques/deep-plane) cases and a complication rate of just 3% versus the industry average of 12%, his approach prioritizes patient safety and realistic expectations above all else.

## What Are PDO Thread Lifts?

PDO (polydioxanone) threads are medical-grade sutures made from a bioabsorbable material that's been used in surgery for decades. When inserted into the skin and subcutaneous tissue, these threads serve two primary functions:

**Mechanical Support:** Barbed or cog threads physically lift sagging tissue by anchoring it to more stable structures. This creates an immediate, albeit modest, lifting effect.

**Biostimulation:** As the threads dissolve over 6-9 months, they trigger a foreign body response that stimulates collagen production. This theoretically provides continued improvement even after the threads have dissolved.

The procedure is performed under local anesthesia, typically takes 30-60 minutes, and involves minimal downtime. Entry points are small punctures rather than incisions, and patients can usually return to work within 1-3 days.

### Types of PDO Threads

Not all threads are created equal. Understanding the different types helps clarify what they can and cannot achieve:

**Smooth Threads:** These lack barbs and provide only biostimulation, not mechanical lifting. They're best for skin quality improvement rather than repositioning tissue.

**Barbed/Cog Threads:** These have small hooks that grab tissue and provide actual lifting force. They're what most people mean when they discuss "thread lifts."

**Screw/Twisted Threads:** These are designed for volume restoration and stimulating collagen in specific areas, particularly around the eyes and lips.

The reality is that even the most aggressive barbed threads can only provide modest lifting force. They're working against gravity through small puncture points, whereas surgical procedures work with larger tissue planes and deeper anatomical structures.

## Surgical Facelift: The Gold Standard

A properly performed facelift isn't just about "pulling skin tight"—that's the outdated approach that gave facelifts a bad reputation in the 1980s. Modern techniques like the [EndomidFace](/en/techniques/endomidface) approach work with the deeper structural layers of the face.

### What Actually Happens in Modern Facelift Surgery

**SMAS Manipulation:** The SMAS (Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System) is a fibrous layer connecting skin to deeper structures. By repositioning this layer, surgeons create lasting support that threads simply cannot achieve.

**Fat Compartment Repositioning:** Aging isn't just about sagging—fat compartments deflate and descend. Modern facelift techniques reposition these compartments to restore youthful volume distribution.

**Ligament Release:** Retaining ligaments hold facial tissues down as we age. Strategic release of these ligaments allows for natural repositioning of tissue—something no thread can accomplish.

**Skin Redraping:** Only after deeper structures are repositioned is the skin redraped—without tension. This is why modern facelift results look natural rather than "pulled."

The [Modern Face philosophy](/en/modern-face/what-is-it) emphasizes working with anatomy rather than against it, using direct visualization rather than blind techniques, and prioritizing long-term results over short-term convenience.

## Evidence-Based Comparison: What the Data Actually Shows

Let's move beyond marketing claims and examine what peer-reviewed research and clinical experience actually demonstrate:

| Aspect | PDO Threads | Surgical Facelift (Modern Techniques) |
|--------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Invasiveness** | Minimal | Surgical |
| **Result Duration** | 6-18 months | 8-12+ years |
| **Degree of Improvement** | Mild to moderate | Moderate to significant |
| **Recovery Time** | 1-3 days | 7-14 days (7 with Modern Face approach) |
| **Complications** | 5-8% (dimpling, asymmetry, thread extrusion) | 3% (Modern Face) vs 12% (traditional) |
| **Anesthesia** | Local | Local with sedation or general |
| **Cost per Year** | Higher (requires repetition) | Lower (lasts 10+ years) |
| **Satisfaction Rate** | 60-70% | 85-95% (Modern Face approach) |

### The Cost-Benefit Reality

Here's what most providers won't tell you: when you calculate cost per year of results, surgical facelift often proves more economical than repeated thread treatments.

**Thread Scenario:** $3,000 per treatment × 10 treatments over 10 years = $30,000 for modest, temporary results

**Facelift Scenario:** $12,000-18,000 for one procedure lasting 10+ years with significant, lasting improvement

This doesn't account for the cumulative risk of multiple procedures versus one well-planned surgery.

## When PDO Threads Make Sense

Despite my surgical expertise, I don't recommend surgery to every patient who walks through my door. Threads have legitimate applications:

### Ideal Thread Candidates

**Early Aging with Minimal Laxity:** Patients in their late 30s to early 40s with very mild jowling or neck laxity may benefit from the collagen stimulation and modest lifting threads provide.

**Medical Contraindications to Surgery:** Patients with health conditions that make general anesthesia risky might opt for threads as a safer alternative, understanding the limitations.

**"Previewing" the Effect:** Some patients use threads to see how they feel about having a more lifted appearance before committing to surgery.

**Adjunct to Surgical Results:** Threads can be strategically used to maintain surgical results between procedures, though this is controversial among surgeons.

**Specific Anatomical Goals:** For certain areas like eyebrow elevation or neck bands, threads can provide targeted improvement without full surgery.

### When Threads Are Not Enough

Be honest with yourself about what you're seeing in the mirror. If you have:

- **Significant Jowling:** Once jowls are prominent, threads lack the strength to adequately lift them.
- **Pronounced Nasolabial Folds:** Threads can't address the deeper volume loss and ligament laxity causing deep folds.
- **Neck Laxity with Platysmal Bands:** Threads can't suture muscle or remove excess skin—both often necessary for neck rejuvenation.
- **Previous Unsuccessful Thread Treatments:** If you've tried threads without satisfactory results, it's unlikely that more threads will solve the problem.

In these cases, threads become an expensive delay of the inevitable. I've consulted with dozens of patients who spent $10,000-15,000 on repeated thread treatments over 3-5 years, only to eventually need surgery anyway.

## When Surgical Facelift Is the Better Choice

The decision for surgery shouldn't be based on fear or convenience—it should be based on matching the procedure to the problem.

### Surgical Candidates: The Profile

**Anatomical Indicators:**
- Moderate to severe jowling
- Loss of jawline definition
- Significant neck laxity or platysmal banding
- Deep nasolabial folds extending to marionette lines
- Midface descent with tear trough hollowing

**Lifestyle Considerations:**
- Willing to take 7-14 days for recovery
- Seeking long-term solution rather than temporary fix
- Realistic expectations about surgical outcomes
- Good overall health
- Non-smoker or willing to quit

**Psychological Readiness:**
- Understanding that surgery is a significant decision
- Prepared for the healing process, including swelling phases
- Aligned with the philosophy of [natural-looking results](/en/blog/natural-facelift-results)

### The Modern Face Advantage

Not all facelifts are created equal. The [Modern Face approach](/en/modern-face/philosophy) differs fundamentally from traditional techniques:

**Less Trauma = Less Swelling = Faster Recovery:** By using direct vision and precise dissection in the correct anatomical planes, tissue trauma is minimized. This translates to the 7-day recovery timeline rather than the traditional 21 days.

**Zero Permanent Nerve Injury in 212 Cases:** This isn't luck—it's the result of systematic surgical technique that prioritizes nerve protection through direct visualization rather than blind dissection.

**3% Complication Rate vs 12% Industry Average:** The data speaks for itself. Proper technique, patient selection, and systematic approach to each case reduces complications to a fraction of the industry standard.

## The Middle Ground: Combination Approaches

For some patients, the answer isn't "threads or surgery"—it's both, used strategically.

### Strategic Combination Scenarios

**Surgical Facelift + Targeted Thread Maintenance:** Some surgeons use threads 5-7 years after facelift to provide a modest "tune-up" and extend the longevity of surgical results.

**Threads for Asymmetry Correction:** After healing from facelift, subtle threads can sometimes address minor asymmetries without revision surgery.

**Complementary Areas:** Surgery for lower face and neck, threads for eyebrow elevation or temporal lifting.

However, these combination approaches require surgical expertise in both modalities and careful timing to avoid complications.

## Making Your Decision: A Framework

Here's the systematic approach I use with my patients:

### Step 1: Honest Assessment

Stand in natural lighting and look at your face from multiple angles. What specifically bothers you? Is it:
- Mild laxity that's barely noticeable?
- Moderate changes that are clearly visible?
- Significant aging that affects your self-perception?

### Step 2: Timeline Consideration

- If you need results for a specific event in 1-2 weeks, threads might be appropriate
- If you can plan 2-3 months ahead, surgery provides better long-term value
- If you're not sure about commitment, threads offer a reversible option

### Step 3: Financial Analysis

Calculate cost-per-year of results:
- Threads: Treatment cost × expected repetitions over 10 years
- Surgery: One-time cost ÷ expected years of results

### Step 4: Consultation with Expertise

Seek consultation with a surgeon who offers both threads AND surgery. A provider who only does threads lacks the surgical perspective to guide you objectively. Similarly, a surgeon who dismisses all nonsurgical options may not be giving you the full picture.

### Step 5: Trial Period Consideration

For borderline candidates, consider trying threads first with the understanding that:
- Results will be modest and temporary
- This is a "trial" not a permanent solution
- Surgery remains an option if threads are insufficient

## Common Misconceptions About Both Procedures

### Thread Myths

**Myth:** "Threads are completely nonsurgical and risk-free."
**Reality:** All procedures carry risks. Thread complications include dimpling, asymmetry, thread migration, infection, and nerve injury (rare but documented).

**Myth:** "Results improve over time as collagen builds."
**Reality:** The mechanical lifting effect diminishes as threads dissolve. While collagen production may continue, it rarely compensates for the loss of mechanical support.

**Myth:** "Threads can achieve the same results as facelift."
**Reality:** No peer-reviewed study supports this claim. Threads provide modest improvement; surgery provides comprehensive correction.

### Facelift Myths

**Myth:** "Facelifts always look 'done' or unnatural."
**Reality:** Bad facelifts look unnatural. Properly performed modern techniques create results so natural that people often can't identify what changed—they just know you look refreshed.

**Myth:** "Recovery takes months."
**Reality:** With modern techniques like those used in the [Modern Face approach](/en/modern-face/principles), most patients return to normal activities in 7-14 days.

**Myth:** "You can only have one facelift in your lifetime."
**Reality:** Well-performed facelifts can be repeated if needed, though most modern procedures last 10+ years.

## The Philosophy Behind the Choice

> "My role is not to give you 'courage'. It's to give you a method so safe that courage becomes irrelevant."
>
> — Dr. Robério Brandão

This philosophy applies equally to the decision between threads and surgery. The choice shouldn't require courage—it should require information, honest self-assessment, and alignment between your goals and the capabilities of each procedure.

Threads are not inferior to surgery; they're different tools for different jobs. A screwdriver isn't inferior to a hammer—it's designed for different applications. The error occurs when we try to use a screwdriver as a hammer or vice versa.

## Real Results: What to Expect from Each

### Thread Lift Results

**Immediate:** Modest lifting visible immediately after procedure, though swelling may obscure this initially.

**2-4 Weeks:** Optimal results as swelling subsides and threads settle into position.

**3-6 Months:** Results gradually diminish as threads dissolve. Collagen stimulation may provide some continued improvement in skin quality.

**12-18 Months:** Most patients see return to baseline, prompting consideration of repeat treatment.

**Patient satisfaction** typically relates to realistic expectations. Those expecting "mini-facelift" results are disappointed; those expecting modest improvement with minimal downtime are often satisfied.

### Modern Facelift Results

**Week 1:** Significant swelling and bruising. This is the "recovery" phase.

**Week 2-4:** Swelling diminishes rapidly. Most patients feel comfortable in public with makeup.

**Month 2-3:** 80% of swelling resolved. Result becoming apparent.

**Month 6:** 90% of final result visible. Scars fading to thin white lines.

**Month 12:** Final result. Mature scars, settled tissues, natural appearance.

**Years 5-10:** Results remain stable. Patient looks like a younger version of themselves, not like a different person.

Our data from 212 [Deep Plane cases](/en/techniques/deep-plane) shows 92% patient satisfaction at 5-year follow-up, with the primary regret being "I wish I'd done this sooner."

## Special Considerations for Surgeons

If you're a surgeon reading this article to better counsel your patients, consider this framework:

**Patient Education:** Set realistic expectations for both procedures. Under-promise and over-deliver rather than the reverse.

**Technical Expertise:** Only offer threads if you're trained in proper technique and understand anatomical landmarks. Thread complications, while less severe than surgical complications, still reflect on your practice.

**Honest Assessment:** Not every patient needs surgery. Building trust by recommending the less invasive option when appropriate establishes credibility for when you do recommend surgery.

**Follow-Up:** Track your thread results systematically. If you're not seeing consistent 12+ month durability, re-evaluate your technique or patient selection criteria.

For surgeons interested in mastering modern facelift techniques, the [Face Moderna training program](/en/education) provides systematic education in evidence-based approaches that prioritize safety and natural results.

## Making Peace with Your Decision

Whether you choose threads or surgery, the key to satisfaction is alignment between expectations and outcomes.

### If You Choose Threads

- **Budget for maintenance:** Plan for treatments every 12-18 months
- **Monitor results:** Take photos to objectively track duration of improvement
- **Have an exit strategy:** Know at what point you'll consider surgery if threads aren't sufficient
- **Choose expertise:** Select a provider experienced specifically in thread techniques

### If You Choose Surgery

- **Plan adequate recovery time:** Don't schedule surgery 2 weeks before a major event
- **Follow protocol:** Post-operative care significantly affects outcomes
- **Trust the process:** Healing takes time; don't judge results before 3-6 months
- **Select your surgeon carefully:** Credentials, experience, and complication rates matter more than cost

## Conclusion: Different Tools for Different Goals

The threads versus facelift debate isn't about which procedure is "better"—it's about which procedure is better for you, right now, given your specific anatomy, goals, and circumstances.

Threads offer modest improvement with minimal commitment. They're ideal for early aging, for patients who want to test the waters, or for those with medical contraindications to surgery. They will not, however, provide the comprehensive, long-lasting correction that surgery offers.

Surgical facelift remains the gold standard for addressing moderate to severe facial aging. Modern techniques have dramatically reduced both recovery time and complication rates, making surgery a more accessible option than many patients realize.

The choice requires honesty—about what you see in the mirror, about your goals, and about your willingness to invest time and resources in your appearance. Neither choice is "right" or "wrong"; they're simply different approaches to the same underlying desire: to look like the best version of yourself.

Whether you choose threads, surgery, or a combination approach, make your decision based on evidence, not marketing. Consult with providers who offer multiple options and have the expertise to guide you objectively. And remember: the goal isn't to look like someone else—it's to look like yourself, just refreshed and rejuvenated.
