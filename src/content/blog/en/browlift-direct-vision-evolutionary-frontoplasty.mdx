faq:
  - question: "What is Direct Vision Browlift?"
    answer: "It is an eyebrow lifting technique that uses a temporal incision (within the hair) and dissection under direct tissue visualization, without the need for an endoscope. It allows precise eyebrow repositioning with a hidden scar."
  - question: "What does 'Evolutionary Frontoplasty' mean?"
    answer: "It is the evolution of traditional frontoplasty, integrating concepts of direct vision, structure preservation, and vertical vectors. It represents the Modern Face® approach to the upper third of the face."
  - question: "Is the Browlift scar visible?"
    answer: "No. The incision is made within the scalp (intracapillary or temporal access), remaining 100% hidden after healing. Even with short or thin hair, the scar is not noticeable."
  - question: "Does Direct Vision Browlift correct forehead wrinkles?"
    answer: "Indirectly, yes. By repositioning the eyebrows and frontal muscle, there is improvement in horizontal lines. However, deep wrinkles may require complementary treatments."
  - question: "Does the Browlift result look natural or 'surprised'?"
    answer: "With the Modern Face® vertical vector technique, the result is natural. The 'frightened' or 'surprised' appearance occurs when there is excessive lateral traction, which is not used in this approach."
  - question: "Can Browlift be combined with Endomidface?"
    answer: "Yes, and frequently is. The Browlift serves as a surgical 'portal' for Endomidface, allowing complete approach to the upper and middle thirds of the face through the same surgical accesses."

The upper third of the face — forehead and eyebrows — defines the expression of youth,
energy, and disposition. Ptotic eyebrows create a tired and aged appearance, often before
the midface shows significant signs.
The **Direct Vision Browlift**, also called
**Evolutionary Frontoplasty**, represents the Modern Face® approach to this
region: safe technique, natural result, without dependence on endoscopic equipment.

## Why Direct Vision Instead of Endoscopic Browlift?
Endoscopic browlift emerged as an attempt to minimize incisions. However, it presents
practical limitations that compromise results in many patients.
### Endoscopic Limitations
- • Dependence on expensive equipment
- • Steep learning curve
- • Difficulty in large or convex foreheads
- • Multiple small incisions
- • Fixation with screws (may be palpable)
- • Less predictable result
### Direct Vision Advantages
- • Conventional instruments
- • Moderate learning curve
- • Works in any anatomy
- • Single incision hidden in hair
- • Fascial fixation (not palpable)
- • More predictable result

## How Direct Vision Browlift Works
### 1. Intracapillary Temporal Access
Incision within the scalp, in the temporal region. Scar is 100% hidden. Allows access
for both browlift and Endomidface.
### 2. Subgaleal Dissection
Dissection in the subgaleal plane (below the galea aponeurotica), under direct vision.
Allows safe identification of the supraorbital nerve and other critical structures.
### 3. Periosteal Release
Careful periosteal release at the superior orbital rim, allowing vertical eyebrow
mobilization without excessive tension.
### 4. Corrugator Management (Optional)
In indicated cases, the corrugator muscle can be treated to reduce glabellar wrinkles.
Conservative approach that preserves expressiveness.
### 5. Deep Temporal Fascia Fixation
Tissue repositioning and fixation to stable structure (deep temporal fascia). No
screws or external devices.

## Browlift as a Portal for Endomidface
One of the great advantages of Direct Vision Browlift in the Modern Face methodology is
serving as **surgical access**
for Endomidface. Through the same temporal incision, the surgeon can:
- 
✓
Perform Browlift (upper third)
- 
✓
Access sub-SMAS plane for Endomidface (midface)
- 
✓
Treat both regions without additional incisions
- 
✓
Reduce total surgical time in combined procedures
This makes the combined procedure (Browlift + Endomidface) more efficient and with faster
recovery than performing each technique separately.

## Natural Result vs. "Surprised Look"
The most common concern about browlift is the fear of looking "frightened" or "surprised".
This occurs when there is excessive lateral eyebrow traction.
### ❌ Lateral Vector (Wrong)
Pulls the eyebrow tail up and out. Creates a "permanent surprise" appearance or
"Mephistophelian" look.
### ✓ Vertical Vector (Modern Face)
Vertical elevation at 90°, respecting the natural eyebrow position. Result:
rejuvenation without artificial appearance.

## Direct Vision Browlift Indications
### ✓ Superciliary Ptosis
Eyebrows in low position, creating tired or heavy appearance
### ✓ Eyebrow Asymmetry
Height or shape difference between eyebrows causing discomfort
### ✓ Superior Dermatochalasis
Excess skin on upper eyelid caused by eyebrow ptosis (not just skin)
### ✓ Moderate Frontal Wrinkles
Horizontal forehead lines that improve with tissue repositioning
### ✓ Complement to Endomidface
As part of complete facial rejuvenation, serving as access portal
