faq:
  - question: "What does 'direct vision' mean in Endomidface?"
    answer: "Direct vision means that the surgeon directly visualizes anatomical structures during surgery, without depending on cameras or monitors. This allows simultaneous tactile feedback to vision, increasing safety and precision of the procedure."
  - question: "Why is Direct Vision Endomidface considered minimally invasive?"
    answer: "Despite working in deep plane, the technique uses smaller incisions, doesn't require complex endoscopic equipment, causes less tissue trauma and allows faster recovery (7-10 days vs 21-30 days of traditional techniques)."
  - question: "Does Direct Vision Endomidface work on faces with biostimulators?"
    answer: "Yes, this is one of the main advantages of the technique. Direct vision allows identifying and safely navigating around areas fibrosedby biostimulators, where blind techniques would be risky."
  - question: "What is the difference between direct vision and video endoscopy?"
    answer: "In video endoscopy, the surgeon sees through a 2D monitor, losing depth perception. In direct vision, there's natural three-dimensional vision combined with tactile feedback, allowing greater control and safety."
  - question: "How long does Direct Vision Endomidface surgery take?"
    answer: "The isolated procedure lasts between 90-120 minutes. When combined with other techniques like Deep Neck or Browlift, total time can vary from 3 to 4 hours."
  - question: "What is the complication rate of Direct Vision Endomidface?"
    answer: "In a series of 212 documented cases, the permanent nerve injury rate was 0%. Minor complications such as bruising and edema are transient and resolve in 7-14 days."
  - question: "Do I need special equipment to perform Direct Vision Endomidface?"
    answer: "No. One of the great advantages is that the technique doesn't require video tower, endoscope or expensive equipment. It uses conventional surgical instruments, making it accessible and reproducible."

The search for a **minimally invasive facelift** that delivers consistent results
without the risks of traditional techniques led to the development of
**Direct Vision Endomidface**. Created by Dr. Robério Brandão, this technique
represents a paradigm shift in midface surgery.
The fundamental differential is in the concept of **direct vision**: the
surgeon visualizes anatomical structures with his own eyes, not through a monitor. This
allows simultaneous tactile feedback, real three-dimensional perception and greater
control over each movement.
> "Direct vision is not a technical limitation — it's an evolution. When you feel and see at
> the same time, your safety multiplies. The endoscope shows; direct vision reveals and
> allows feeling."

## Why Direct Vision instead of Video Endoscopy?
Facial video endoscopy emerged as an attempt to minimize incisions. However, it brings
important limitations that compromise safety, especially in modern faces treated with
biostimulators.
### Limitations of Video Endoscopy:
- 
✗
**2D vision on monitor** — loss of depth perception
- 
✗
**No simultaneous tactile feedback** — surgeon doesn't feel while seeing
- 
✗
**Equipment dependency** — video tower, camera, lighting
- 
✗
**Steep learning curve** — indirect eye-hand coordination
- 
✗
**Risk in fibrous faces** — difficult to navigate altered tissue
### Advantages of Direct Vision:
- 
✓
**Natural 3D vision** — real depth perception
- 
✓
**Simultaneous tactile + visual feedback** — seeing and feeling at the same
time
- 
✓
**No special equipment** — conventional instruments
- 
✓
**Moderate learning curve** — 30 cases to mastery
- 
✓
**Safe in injected faces** — visual identification of fibrosis

## How Direct Vision Endomidface Works
The technique works in the sub-SMAS areolar plane of the midface, using strategic access
that allows direct visualization of structures without need for large incisions.
### 1. Surgical Access
Temporal incision (within the hair) + access through lower eyelid when necessary.
Scars are completely hidden.
### 2. Dissection Plane
Dissection in sub-SMAS areolar plane (natural descent space). Different from Deep
Plane that enters musculature, Endomidface respects natural anatomical spaces.
### 3. Ligament Release
Controlled release of retaining ligaments (zygomatic-cutaneous, orbito-malar) under
direct vision, allowing vertical tissue mobilization without excessive tension.
### 4. Traction Vector
Vertical vector at 90° (not oblique as traditional techniques). This corrects true
ptosis without creating "pulled" appearance or distorting natural anatomy.
### 5. Deep Fixation
Fixation to stable structures (deep temporal fascia), ensuring result longevity
without depending only on skin.

## Facial Surgery without Endoscopic Tower: Technical Liberation
One of the biggest barriers for surgeons to master advanced facial rejuvenation techniques
is dependency on expensive equipment. Video endoscopy towers cost tens of thousands of
dollars, require constant maintenance and can fail during procedures.
### 💡 Real Economic Advantage
Direct Vision Endomidface uses only conventional surgical instruments. This means that
any well-trained surgeon can execute the technique in any adequate surgical center,
without additional investment in equipment.
This **"technical liberation"** democratizes access to excellence results. What
was once privilege of few centers with sophisticated equipment can now be reproduced by trained
surgeons in any hospital structure.

## Documented Results: Proven Safety
The series of 212 consecutive cases by Dr. Robério Brandão demonstrates the safety and
efficacy of the technique in real scenario.
0%
Permanent Nerve Injury
212
Documented Cases
7-10d
Social Recovery
&lt;3%
Minor Complications
These numbers gain even more relevance when we consider that a large portion of patients
already had faces previously treated with biostimulators — exactly the scenario considered
"at risk" for traditional techniques.

## For Whom is Direct Vision Endomidface Indicated?
### ✓ Ideal Indications
- • Midface ptosis (descended malar)
- • Deep nasolabial fold
- • Faces with previous biostimulators
- • Patients who want natural result
- • Patients seeking fast recovery
- • Complement to Browlift or Deep Neck
### ✗ Limitations
- • Doesn't treat jowls (requires complement)
- • Doesn't address neck in isolation
- • Excess skin requires additional procedure
- • Unrealistic expectations of result
