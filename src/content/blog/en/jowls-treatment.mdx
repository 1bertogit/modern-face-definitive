## What are Jowls?
**Jowls** are the "packets" of tissue that sag below the jawline, creating an interruption
in facial contour. They represent the combination of lower third fat ptosis and SMAS laxity.
The **double chin** is the accumulation of fat and loose skin in the submental
region.
## Why are Jowls Difficult to Treat?
- 
• **Mandibular ligament:** Keeps tissue "fixed" on jawbone while rest descends
- • **Multiple layers:** Skin, fat and SMAS all contribute
- • **Limited fillers:** Don't correct, only camouflage
- • **Insufficient liposuction:** Fat is not the only problem
## Surgical Treatment
Effective jowl correction requires **deep plane approach** (SMAS or sub-SMAS) combined
with mandibular ligament release and vertical tissue repositioning. Deep Neck complements by
treating the cervical region.
