faq:
  - question: "What is Deep Neck?"
    answer: "Deep Neck is a deep cervical rejuvenation technique that addresses the platysma, subplatysmal fat, and digastric muscle. The Modern Face version, taught by Dr. Robério Brandão, has as its differential the preservation of the submandibular gland — eliminating risks of xerostomia and permanent salivary alterations."
  - question: "What's the difference between Deep Neck and traditional neck lift?"
    answer: "Traditional lifting primarily works on the skin and superficial SMAS. Deep Neck goes beyond, addressing deep structures: platysma at the midline (Platysmaplasty), subplatysmal fat, anterior belly of the digastric (Digastric Shaving), and submandibular gland (Glandular Loop for repositioning, not removal)."
  - question: "Why not remove the submandibular gland?"
    answer: "Although submandibular gland removal creates a more defined cervical contour, it carries significant risks: xerostomia (dry mouth), marginal mandibular nerve injury, and lingual nerve injury. The Glandular Loop technique repositions the gland without removing it, obtaining excellent aesthetic results with a much lower risk profile."
  - question: "What is Platysmaplasty?"
    answer: "Platysmaplasty is the suturing of the medial edges of the platysma muscle at the cervical midline. This maneuver recreates the cervicomental angle, corrects platysmal bands, and provides lasting structural support. It is one of the pillars of the Modern Face Deep Neck."
  - question: "What is Digastric Shaving?"
    answer: "Digastric Shaving is the controlled reduction of the volume of the anterior belly of the digastric muscle. Hypertrophic digastric muscles create submental fullness even after liposuction. Shaving reduces this volume safely, respecting the insertion and muscle function."
  - question: "How long does Deep Neck surgery take?"
    answer: "Isolated Deep Neck takes approximately 90-150 minutes. When combined with Endomidface (complete face approach), total time varies from 3-4 hours. The technique allows use of local anesthesia with sedation in most cases."
  - question: "What is the Deep Neck recovery like?"
    answer: "Cervical edema is expected for 7-14 days, with use of compression garment. Most patients return to social activities in 10-14 days. Hematomas are uncommon (&lt;2%) with proper technique. Final result stabilizes in 3-6 months."
  - question: "Does Deep Neck leave visible scars?"
    answer: "The main incision is submental (under the chin), hidden in the natural shadow. When combined with facelift, additional pre-auricular incisions are made in natural folds. With proper technique, scars are virtually imperceptible."
  - question: "Does Deep Neck work for double chin?"
    answer: "Yes, Deep Neck is excellent for double chin — especially when caused by subplatysmal fat and ptosis of deep structures. Cases of double chin only from subcutaneous fat can be treated with isolated liposuction, but most patients benefit from the complete approach."
  - question: "Can I combine Deep Neck with other procedures?"
    answer: "Yes, and this combination is often ideal. Deep Neck + Endomidface addresses face and neck in a single surgery. It can also be combined with blepharoplasty, rhinoplasty, and non-surgical procedures. The Modern Face Institute's Legacy Combo teaches exactly this integration."

## Introduction: The Neck Challenge
The neck is often called the "age tell-tale". While the face can be rejuvenated with
fillers and non-invasive treatments, the neck resists: platysmal bands, submental fat
and deep structure ptosis do not respond to superficial treatments.
**Deep Neck** (deep necklift) emerged as an answer to this challenge. Unlike
traditional cervical lifting that works only on the skin and superficial SMAS, Deep Neck addresses
the deep structures responsible for cervical aging: platysma, subplatysmal fat, digastric
muscle and submandibular gland.
However, many Deep Neck techniques include **submandibular gland removal** —
a procedure that, although aesthetically effective, carries significant risks of xerostomia
(dry mouth) and nerve injury.
> "The art of Deep Neck is achieving maximum cervical definition without sacrificing
> functional structures. The submandibular gland doesn't need to be removed — it needs to
> be repositioned."

> - — Dr. Robério Brandão
This article presents the **Modern Face Deep Neck** approach: a deep cervical
rejuvenation technique that preserves the submandibular gland through the **Glandular Loop**, achieving equivalent aesthetic results with a superior safety profile.

## Relevant Anatomy for Deep Neck
To safely perform Deep Neck, the surgeon must master the anatomy of deep cervical
structures:
### Cervical Layers (Superficial → Deep)

1
**Skin:** Thin and mobile in the cervical region

2
**Subcutaneous fat:** Variable, target of initial liposuction

3
**Platysma:** Thin muscle that forms visible "bands" with aging

4
**Subplatysmal fat:** Deep accumulation to the platysma, not accessible
by conventional liposuction

5
**Digastric muscle:** Anterior belly can be hypertrophic, causing fullness

6
**Submandibular gland:** Can prolapse inferiorly with aging

### At-Risk Structures
#### Marginal Mandibular Nerve
Facial nerve branch that innervates lower lip depressors. Injury causes smile
asymmetry. Crosses mandible ~2cm posterior to angle.
#### Lingual Nerve
Risk during submandibular gland removal. Injury causes hemitongue anesthesia.
Preserved in Glandular Loop technique.
#### External Jugular Vein
Superficial to platysma. Must be identified and preserved or properly ligated during
dissection.
#### Wharton's Duct
Submandibular gland duct. Injury causes sialocele or salivary fistula. Preserved
with Glandular Loop technique.

## The Four Pillars of Modern Face Deep Neck
The Modern Face Deep Neck technique is structured on four main maneuvers, each
addressing a specific component of cervical aging:

## Operative Sequence
1.
#### Markings and Infiltration
Marking of platysmal bands, liposuction area and submental incision. Tumescent
infiltration.
2.
#### Initial Liposuction
Removal of subcutaneous and pre-platysmal fat. Defines subsequent dissection
plane.
3.
#### Incision and Exposure
Submental incision of ~3-4cm. Dissection until visualizing medial edges of
platysma.
4.
#### Platysmaplasty
Suture of medial edges of platysma with interrupted nylon or PDS stitches.
Recreates cervicomental angle.
5.
#### Subplatysmal Fat
Direct resection of fat deep to platysma. Direct visualization allows precision.
6.
#### Digastric Shaving
If indicated, reduction of hypertrophic anterior belly with electrocautery.
Preserves insertion and function.
7.
#### Glandular Loop
If necessary, retention suture to reposition prolapsed submandibular gland.
WITHOUT removal.
8.
#### Closure and Dressing
Layered closure. Cervical compression garment. Postoperative instructions.

## Why NOT Remove the Submandibular Gland?
Submandibular gland excision is advocated by some authors for maximum mandibular contour
definition. However, this approach carries risks that we consider unnecessary:

Complication
Incidence
Consequence

Xerostomia
10-30%
Permanent dry mouth, difficulty swallowing

Marginal nerve injury
2-5%
Smile asymmetry, lip weakness

Lingual nerve injury
1-3%
Hemitongue anesthesia, dysgeusia

Salivary fistula
2-5%
Saliva drainage through incision

Hematoma
5-10%
Bleeding in glandular bed

The **Glandular Loop** technique achieves comparable aesthetic result (superior
repositioning of the gland) without the risks associated with removal. The gland remains functional,
the duct intact, and the nerves protected.
#### ✅ Advantages of Glandular Preservation
- • Zero risk of permanent xerostomia
- • Lower risk of nerve injury
- • Faster procedure
- • More predictable recovery
- • Equivalent aesthetic result
