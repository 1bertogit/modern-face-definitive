# [Facelift](/en/blog/facelift-complete-guide) in Smokers: Risks and the Modern Face Protocol for Safe Surgery

The facelift, or [rhytidectomy](/en/blog/rhytidectomy-complete-guide), is a surgical procedure aimed at rejuvenating the face, smoothing wrinkles, sagging, and restoring facial contour. However, for smokers, this journey towards rejuvenation requires doubled care. Smoking negatively impacts healing and significantly increases risks of complications.

This article explores specific dangers of smoking in relation to facelift and presents Modern Face protocol, developed by Dr. Robério Brandão, to minimize these risks and optimize surgical results in patients who smoke or have smoked.

## Understanding Risks: Why is Smoking a Problem for Facelift?

Nicotine and other substances present in cigarettes cause a series of harmful effects that compromise success of a facelift:

*   **Vasoconstriction:** Nicotine narrows blood vessels, reducing blood flow to skin. This hinders arrival of oxygen and essential nutrients for healing.
*   **Decreased Collagen Production:** Smoking interferes with production of collagen, fundamental protein for skin elasticity and firmness.
*   **Increased Risk of Skin Necrosis:** Combination of vasoconstriction and decreased collagen increases risk of necrosis, meaning death of skin tissue, especially in areas where skin is thinner and circulation is already compromised by surgery.
*   **Poor Quality Scars:** Smokers tend to develop thicker, reddish scars with higher probability of keloids.
*   **Infections:** Smoking weakens immune system, making patient more susceptible to post-operative infections.
*   **Anesthesia Problems:** Smokers have higher risk of respiratory complications during anesthesia.

## The Modern Face Protocol: Minimizing Risks and Optimizing Results

Dr. Robério Brandão, creator of Modern Face philosophy, developed specific protocol for smoking patients wishing to perform facelift. Goal is to mitigate risks associated with smoking and ensure best possible healing and result.

### 1. Rigorous Pre-Operative Approach

First step is frank and detailed conversation with patient about risks of smoking and importance of stopping.

*   **Total Abstinence:** Patient must commit to stopping smoking for at least 30 days before surgery. Ideally, they should stop permanently.
*   **Nicotine Tests:** In some cases, urine test may be requested to check for presence of nicotine in patient's body.
*   **Multidisciplinary Support:** We encourage patient to seek medical and psychological support to assist in process of quitting smoking.

### 2. Detailed Pre-Operative Evaluation

Complete evaluation is essential to identify additional risk factors and personalize surgical plan.

*   **Medical History:** Investigate other health conditions that may affect healing, such as diabetes and autoimmune diseases.
*   **Physical Exam:** Assess skin quality, presence of previous scars, and blood circulation in face.
*   **Ultrasound:** In patients with history of fillers or biostimulators, ultrasound is fundamental to map presence of fibrosis and plan surgical approach with precision.

### 3. Minimally Invasive Surgical Technique

Modern Face philosophy prioritizes techniques minimizing surgical trauma and preserving blood circulation in skin.

*   **Endomidface by Direct Vision:** This technique, developed by Dr. Robério Brandão, allows performing midface lift through small incisions and with precise dissection, minimizing tissue damage.
*   **Local Anesthesia with Sedation:** Local anesthesia reduces risk of respiratory complications and allows faster recovery.
*   **Avoid Excessive Tension:** During skin repositioning, it is fundamental to avoid excessive tension, which can compromise circulation and increase risk of necrosis.
*   **Strategic Incisions:** Incisions are planned to follow natural skin lines and minimize scar visibility.

### 4. Rigorous Post-Operative Care

Post-operative follow-up is crucial to ensure proper healing and prevent complications.

*   **Rest:** Patient should avoid intense physical activities and sudden movements in face during first weeks.
*   **Dressings:** Dressings should be changed regularly, following medical instructions.
*   **Hygiene:** Keeping operated area clean and dry is fundamental to prevent infections.
*   **Nutrition:** Diet rich in proteins, vitamins, and minerals is essential to promote healing.
*   **Smoking Cessation:** Reinforce importance of not smoking during entire recovery period.
*   **Hyperbaric Chamber:** In selected cases, therapy with hyperbaric oxygen can be used to improve tissue oxygenation and accelerate healing.

### 5. Continuous Monitoring and Early Intervention

Regular medical follow-up is essential to identify and treat any complication early.

*   **Warning Signs:** Patient should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if presenting signs of infection (redness, swelling, pain, pus), skin necrosis (dark coloration, wounds), or other unusual symptoms.
*   **Immediate Treatment:** If any complication occurs, treatment should be started as soon as possible to minimize damage.

## Alternatives to Facelift for Smokers

For patients who cannot or do not want to stop smoking, there are non-surgical alternatives that can provide more subtle facial rejuvenation.

*   **Hyaluronic Acid Fillers:** Fills wrinkles and furrows, restoring lost volume.
*   **Botulinum Toxin (Botox)::** Smooths expression wrinkles, such as crow's feet and forehead lines.
*   **Collagen Biostimulators:** Stimulate collagen production, improving skin firmness and elasticity.
*   **Laser and Radiofrequency:** Promote skin resurfacing, attenuating fine wrinkles and spots.

It is important to emphasize that these procedures do not provide same results as surgical facelift, but can be option for patients who are not candidates for surgery due to smoking.

## The Decision is Yours: Prioritize Health and Lasting Beauty

Facelift can be transformative experience, but for smokers, requires serious commitment to health and well-being. Stopping smoking is fundamental to minimize risks of complications and ensure lasting and satisfactory result.

Remember: your health is most precious asset. When making decision to perform facelift, prioritize healthy lifestyle and strictly follow all medical instructions.

## What to Expect: Recovery Timeline

Recovery is a journey requiring patience and specific care in each phase. Knowing what to expect helps reduce anxiety and optimize results.

### First 24-48 Hours

This is most delicate period. It is normal to present:

- **Moderate to intense edema**: swelling is maximum in this period
- **Bruising**: purple spots may appear and are natural part of healing
- **Controllable discomfort**: pain is generally mild to moderate, controlled with prescribed analgesics
- **Need for absolute rest**: avoid sudden movements and keep head elevated

### First Week (Days 3-7)

From third day, you will start noticing progressive improvements:

- Edema begins to decrease gradually
- Bruises change color (purple → green → yellow)
- Stitches and dressings can be removed as per medical guidance
- Light activities can be resumed with caution

### Weeks 2-4

Important transition phase:

- Gradual return to social and professional activities
- Residual edema still present, but less perceptible
- Result begins to define itself, although not yet definitive
- Lymphatic drainage massages may be indicated

### Months 1-3

Final result consolidates progressively:

- Tissues settle in definitive position
- Scars mature and become less visible
- Sensitivity gradually returns to normal
- Final result visible between 3-6 months

> "Patience is fundamental. Final result of facial procedure can only be evaluated after 6 months, when all tissues have stabilized." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## Detailed Post-Operative Care

Procedure success depends as much on surgical technique as on post-operative care.

### First Days: Critical Phase

In this phase, small cares make big difference:

- **Elevated rest**: keep head elevated at 30-45° even when sleeping
- **Cold compresses**: apply in first 48h to reduce edema
- **Rigorous medication**: follow exactly prescribed schedules
- **Light diet**: prefer soft foods and avoid excessive chewing
- **Abundant hydration**: water helps in tissue recovery

### First Week: Intermediate Care

As healing advances:

- **Careful hygiene**: clean area as directed, without rubbing
- **Avoid sun exposure**: use hat and sunscreen when necessary to go out
- **Gentle facial movements**: avoid exaggerated expressions
- **Adequate sleep**: body recovers mainly during sleep
- **Avoid alcohol and tobacco**: both harm healing

### Weeks 2-4: Gradual Return

Return to activities should be progressive:

- **Light activities**: short walks are allowed
- **Remote work**: can be resumed as per comfort
- **Light makeup**: generally allowed after 2 weeks
- **Moderate exercises**: only with medical clearance
- **Lymphatic drainage**: indicated to accelerate recovery

### What to Avoid

During entire recovery period:

- Direct sun exposure on operated areas
- Intense physical activities before clearance
- Alcohol consumption in first 2 weeks
- Smoking (ideally stop 4 weeks before and after)
- Non-prescribed anti-inflammatories
- Sudden movements with face
