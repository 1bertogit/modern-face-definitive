## What Are Facial Exercises and How Do They Work?

Facial exercises, also known as facial gymnastics or "face yoga," are a series of movements and massages aimed at strengthening facial muscles. The idea is that by toning these muscles, the skin becomes firmer and wrinkles are attenuated.

But how does this work in practice? Facial exercises act on three main levels:

1.  **Muscle tone:** They strengthen facial muscles, which support the skin.
2.  **Blood circulation:** They increase blood flow to the face, promoting better nutrition of skin cells.
3.  **Muscle relaxation:** Some exercises help relax tense muscles, smoothing expression lines.

It is important to emphasize that the effectiveness of facial exercises is still a subject of debate in the scientific community.

### Potential Benefits of Facial Exercises

Although scientific research is still limited, some studies point to the following benefits of facial exercises:

*   **Improved muscle tone:** A study from Northwestern University demonstrated that facial exercises can increase muscle thickness and improve facial appearance.
*   **Increased blood circulation:** Facial massage can increase blood flow, which may contribute to healthier and more radiant skin.
*   **Muscle relaxation:** Relaxation exercises can help alleviate muscle tension, smoothing expression lines caused by stress.

### Risks and Limitations of Facial Exercises

Despite potential benefits, it is crucial to be aware of the risks and limitations of facial exercises:

*   **Accentuation of wrinkles:** If performed incorrectly, certain exercises can actually accentuate wrinkles and expression lines.
*   **Limited results:** Facial exercises do not eliminate skin sagging or excess skin, problems that generally require surgical intervention.
*   **Need for consistency:** To obtain results, one must practice exercises regularly, which requires discipline and time.

## Surgical Facelift: A Proven Solution for Sagging

A surgical facelift, also known as rhytidectomy, is a procedure aimed at reversing signs of facial aging, such as sagging, wrinkles, and volume loss.

Unlike facial exercises, which act on muscles, a surgical facelift acts on several layers of the face, including skin, fat, and muscles.

### How Does a Surgical Facelift Combat Aging?

A surgical facelift offers a more comprehensive and lasting approach to facial rejuvenation, acting on different levels:

1.  **Repositioning of structures:** The surgeon repositions muscles and facial fat, restoring lost volume and improving contour.
2.  **Removal of excess skin:** A surgical facelift removes excess skin, eliminating sagging and wrinkles.
3.  **Suspension of structures:** Facial structures are suspended in a more youthful position, providing a more reliable result.

### Facelift Techniques: From Surface to Deep Plane

There are different facelift techniques, varying according to the depth of intervention:

*   **[SMAS](/en/blog/smas-anatomy) Lifting:** Acts on the Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System (SMAS) layer, repositioning muscles and facial fat.
*   **Deep Plane Facelift:** Involves releasing and repositioning facial structures in a deeper plane, providing more natural and lasting results.
*   **Endomidface:** Focused on the midface region, it lifts tissues and improves malar contour.
*   **Modern Face:** The Modern Face philosophy, created by Dr. Robério Brandão, seeks to combine minimally invasive techniques with natural and lasting results.

[Table: Comparison between different facelift techniques]

| Technique | Depth | Focus | Results |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SMAS Lifting | SMAS | Muscles and facial fat | Moderate improvement of sagging and contour. |
| Deep Plane Facelift | Deep plane | Deep repositioning of tissues | More natural and lasting results. |
| Endomidface | SMAS/deep | Midface elevation | Improvement of malar contour and reduction of lower eyelid length. |
| Modern Face | Variable | Approach personalization | Natural and lasting results with minimally invasive techniques. |

### Risks and Benefits of Surgical Facelift

Like any surgical procedure, a facelift presents risks and benefits that must be carefully considered:

*   **Benefits:** More dramatic and lasting results, significant improvement of sagging and facial contour.
*   **Risks:** Hematomas, swelling, infection, nerve injury (rare), scars.

It is fundamental to choose a qualified and experienced plastic surgeon to minimize risks and ensure a satisfactory result.

## Facial Exercises vs Facelift: Which Is the Best Option For You?

The choice between facial exercises and surgical facelift depends on several factors, including:

*   **Degree of sagging:** Facial exercises are more suitable for mild cases of sagging, while a facelift is recommended for more advanced cases.
*   **Expectations:** If you seek dramatic and lasting results, a facelift is the best option. If you seek subtle and natural improvement, facial exercises may be sufficient.
*   **Availability:** Facial exercises require discipline and time, while a facelift involves a recovery period.
*   **Costs:** Facial exercises are free, while a surgical facelift involves significant costs.

### The Modern Face Vision: A Balance Between Approaches

In the Modern Face philosophy, the goal is always to seek **natural and lasting rejuvenation**, with **minimal invasive intervention**.

In the words of Dr. Robério Brandão:

*"Modern Face seeks to harmonize surgical techniques with the most modern in rejuvenation, always prioritizing patient safety and well-being."*

In many cases, this means combining different approaches:

*   **Facial exercises:** Can be used as a complement to a facelift, to maintain muscle tone and prolong results.
*   **Surgical facelift:** Offers a proven and lasting solution for sagging and excess skin, but should be combined with a healthy lifestyle and skin care.

## Post-Operative Warning Signs

Knowing warning signs allows recognizing any complication early and acting quickly.

### When to Seek Surgeon Immediately

Some signs require urgent medical evaluation:

- **Active bleeding** that does not stop with light compression for 10-15 minutes
- **Fever** above 38°C (100.4°F), especially if accompanied by chills
- **Intense and sudden pain** not controlled with prescribed medication
- **Abrupt asymmetry** — much larger swelling on one side may indicate hematoma
- **Skin color change** — paleness or darkening in specific areas
- **Purulent discharge** with unpleasant odor

### Normal Signs (Do Not Worry)

These symptoms are expected and do not require concern:

- **Moderate edema** in the first days, especially in the morning
- **Bruising** (purple spots) that change color progressively
- **Tingling or numbness** temporarily in the operated area
- **Pulling sensation** as tissues heal
- **Small temporary symmetries** due to irregular edema
- **Difficulty smiling** or moving face in the first days

### Safety Protocol

In case of doubt, follow this protocol:

1. **Document** — take photos and note symptoms
2. **Contact** — call the surgeon's team
3. **Do not self-medicate** — avoid non-prescribed medications
4. **Stay calm** — most complications are manageable

## Conclusion: The Conscious Choice For Ideal Rejuvenation

The decision between facial exercises and surgical facelift is personal and should be based on your needs, expectations, and lifestyle.

If you seek subtle and natural improvement, facial exercises can be a good option. However, if you desire dramatic and lasting results for sagging and excess skin, a surgical facelift remains the best alternative.
