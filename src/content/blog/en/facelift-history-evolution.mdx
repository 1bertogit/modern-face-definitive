faq:
  - question: "When did the first facelift emerge?"
    answer: "First reports date from early 20th century (1901-1910), with European surgeons like Hollander and Lexer. They were simple skin removal procedures, very different from current techniques."
  - question: "What was SMAS and why was it revolutionary?"
    answer: "SMAS (Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System) was described in 1974. The perception that there was a structural layer below the skin that could be manipulated transformed facelift from cutaneous to structural procedure with much more durable results."
  - question: "What differentiates Deep Plane from previous techniques?"
    answer: "Deep Plane (Hamra, 1990) dissects below SMAS in a single plane, releasing retaining ligaments. This allows broad tissue mobilization without skin tension. More natural and lasting results than traditional SMAS plication."
  - question: "Why did old techniques give 'pulled' results?"
    answer: "'Skin-only' techniques removed only skin, creating excessive lateral tension. Without structural manipulation, skin was stretched over ptotic tissues. The result was artificial appearance and short durability."
  - question: "What is Modern Face and how does it relate to this history?"
    answer: "Modern Face (2020s) recognizes that facial anatomy changed with biostimulator popularization. Traditional techniques were developed for biofiller-free faces. Modern Face adapts surgery to current reality."
  - question: "What's the future of facelift?"
    answer: "Trends include increasingly less invasive techniques, greater use of local anesthesia, personalization based on individual anatomy, and integration with non-surgical treatments. The pursuit of naturalness and quick recovery continues."

## Why History Matters
Understanding facelift evolution isn't academic exercise — it's fundamental to
understand why we do what we do today. Each current technique, from [Endomidface to advanced Deep Neck procedures, is a response to limitations of previous ones. Knowing history allows more informed
choices.
> "Those who don't know technique history are doomed to repeat past errors. Facelift
> evolved for a reason — each change came from a lesson learned."
