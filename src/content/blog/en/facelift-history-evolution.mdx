# History of Facelift: An Evolution of Techniques (1901-2025)

The facelift, or rhytidectomy, is a surgical procedure seeking to rejuvenate the face's appearance, attenuating visible signs of aging. The journey of the facelift, from its modest origins to today's sophisticated techniques, is a fascinating story of innovation, challenges, and the relentless pursuit of aesthetic perfection. This article explores the facelift's evolution, from its birth in the early 20th century to modern approaches, like [Endomidface](/en/blog/endomidface-complete-guide), prioritizing natural results and optimized recovery.

## The Beginnings: 1901-1960 – The Quest for Visible Results

The first documented facelift was performed in 1901 by German surgeon Eugen Holländer in Berlin. An elderly actress requested the removal of wrinkles and sagging on her face to rejuvenate her appearance. Holländer removed an ellipse of skin around the ears, repositioning facial skin and improving contour. Although rudimentary, this procedure marked the beginning of modern facelift surgery.

During the first decades, Holländer's technique was improved by other surgeons, who experimented with different incisions and skin fixation methods. However, these early facelifts focused mainly on removing excess skin, without addressing underlying structures like muscles and fat. This often resulted in artificial and short-lived results, as well as visible scars and social stigma.

In the 1920s, World War I drove advances in reconstructive surgery, also influencing aesthetic surgery. Surgeons like Suzanne Noël in France, and Raymond Passot, also in France, refined incision and skin manipulation techniques, seeking more natural results. However, lack of understanding of deep facial anatomy limited the effectiveness and durability of procedures.

### The Skin Era: Limited Results and Visible Scars

Until the 1960s, facelifts were predominantly skin-focused, resulting in limited and unnatural results. The technique consisted mainly of pulling and removing excess skin, without addressing underlying structures like muscles and fat.

This approach resulted in:

*   **Artificial results:** Excessively stretched skin created a “stretched” and unnatural appearance.
*   **Visible scars:** Incisions were often positioned in prominent areas, like in front of the ears, making scars evident.
*   **Short duration:** Only skin was treated, sagging returned quickly as underlying structures were not strengthened.

### Anesthesia Evolution and Impact on Facial Surgery

Advances in anesthesia, such as the introduction of local anesthesia with sedation, allowed for longer and more complex procedures, directly impacting facial surgery. This enabled surgeons to explore more invasive techniques and manipulate deeper facial structures.

## The SMAS Revolution: 1960-1980 – A New Understanding of Facial Anatomy

The 1960s marked a fundamental change in facelift surgery with the discovery and understanding of the Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System (SMAS). This fibromuscular layer, located below the skin and subcutaneous fat, is responsible for facial support and contour.

[Image: Diagram illustrating the SMAS layer]

In 1976, Swedish plastic surgeon Tord Skoog published a revolutionary article demonstrating the importance of SMAS in facial support. He described how manipulation and repositioning of the SMAS could provide more lasting and natural results in facelift.

This discovery led to the development of new techniques aiming to manipulate the SMAS, such as plication (folding and suturing) and resection (removal) of the SMAS. These techniques allowed surgeons to reposition facial tissues more effectively, correcting sagging and restoring facial contour.

### The SMAS Era: Lasting and Natural Results

The introduction of SMAS techniques revolutionized the facelift, providing more lasting and natural results. SMAS manipulation allowed:

*   **More lasting results:** By strengthening facial support structures, sagging took longer to return.
*   **More natural appearance:** SMAS manipulation allowed softer and more harmonious repositioning of facial tissues.
*   **Reduced skin tension:** By supporting deep tissues, skin did not need to be excessively stretched, resulting in less visible scars.

[Table: Comparison between skin-focused techniques and SMAS techniques]

| Feature             | Skin-Focused Techniques | SMAS Techniques       |
|---------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| Main focus          | Skin removal            | SMAS repositioning    |
| Durability          | Short                   | Long                  |
| Appearance          | Artificial              | Natural               |
| Skin tension        | High                    | Low                   |
| Scar visibility     | High                    | Low                   |

## The Quest for Precision: 1980-2000 – Deep Plane and Minimally Invasive Techniques

In the late 20th century, facelift surgery continued to evolve with the development of more precise and minimally invasive techniques. The Deep Plane Facelift gained prominence as an approach aiming to reposition deep facial tissues, including SMAS and retaining ligaments. This technique allowed even more natural and lasting results but also required deep knowledge of facial anatomy and advanced surgical skills.

Endoscopic surgery also emerged as a minimally invasive alternative to traditional facelift. Using small incisions and a video camera, surgeons could visualize and manipulate facial structures with greater precision, resulting in less trauma and faster recovery.

### The Precision Era: Minimally Invasive and Personalized Techniques

Minimally invasive techniques, such as endoscopic surgery and Deep Plane Facelift, revolutionized the facelift, allowing:

*   **Less surgical trauma:** Smaller incisions and more precise techniques resulted in less swelling, bruising, and pain.
*   **Faster recovery:** Patients could return to normal activities in a shorter period.
*   **Personalized results:** Techniques allowed surgeons to adapt the procedure to individual needs and goals of each patient.
