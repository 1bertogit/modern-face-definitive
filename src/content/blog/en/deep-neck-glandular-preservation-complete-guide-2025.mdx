# [Deep Neck](/en/blog/deep-neck-complete-guide) with Glandular Preservation: Complete Guide 2025

**Deep Neck with Glandular Preservation** represents the evolution of cervical contour surgery, prioritizing natural results, safety, and optimized recovery. Created within the **[Modern Face](/en/blog/modern-face-concept-philosophy)** philosophy, this approach, led by Dr. Robério Brandão, revolutionizes how we view neck rejuvenation.

In this complete guide, you will discover how to achieve a defined and elegant cervical contour, minimizing risks and recovery time, without the need to remove the submandibular gland.

## What is Deep Neck? Unraveling the Concept

The term **Deep Neck**, or deep neck lift, refers to a set of surgical techniques aimed at improving cervical contour, acting on structures **below the platysma muscle**. This approach goes beyond simple superficial fat removal, seeking a structural and lasting result.

### Modern Deep Neck: The Evolution

**Modern Deep Neck**, within the Modern Face philosophy, represents a significant advance over traditional techniques. It is characterized by:

- **Submandibular gland preservation**: Minimizes risks and complications.
- **Focus on deep structures**: Treats subplatysmal fat, digastric muscle, and cervical fascia.
- **Natural results**: Seeks an elegant and defined contour, without the artificial look.
- **Optimized recovery**: Allows a faster return to daily activities.

## Why Preserve the Submandibular Gland? The Essence of Safety

The decision to preserve the submandibular gland is one of the pillars of the Modern Face philosophy. This choice, which may seem conservative at first glance, is based on a careful analysis of the risks and benefits of gland removal.

### Risks of Gland Removal

Submandibular gland removal is a delicate procedure involving significant risks:

- **Hemorrhage**: The region is richly vascularized, and gland removal can lead to bleeding difficult to control.
- **Nerve injury**: The marginal mandibular nerve and other important nerve branches pass close to the gland, increasing injury risk.
- **Salivary fistula**: Gland removal can result in salivary fistulas, requiring prolonged treatment.

### The Safe Alternative: Focus on Deep Structures

Instead of removing the gland, Modern Deep Neck focuses on treating structures that actually contribute to cervical contour:

- **Subplatysmal fat**: Careful removal of fat below the platysma helps define the neck.
- **Digastric muscle**: Reduction (shaving) of the digastric muscle contributes to a smoother and more elegant contour.
- **Cervical fascia**: Releasing the cervical fascia allows for better tissue repositioning.

### The Glandular Loop: Refining Contour without Risks

In some cases, even with deep structure treatment, the submandibular gland may remain prominent. In these cases, Dr. Robério uses the **glandular loop** technique:

- A strategic suture that "hides" the gland without removing it.
- The loop repositions the gland, creating a smoother and more natural contour.
- The technique is minimally invasive and does not present the risks associated with gland removal.

## Applied Anatomy: Unlocking Neck Secrets

To perform a Deep Neck safely and effectively, it is fundamental to know the region's anatomy. Let's explore the main structures involved:

### The Platysma: The Superficial Layer

The platysma is a thin, wide muscle extending from the chest to the mandible. It plays an important role in facial expression and neck support.

- **Platysmaplasty**: Suturing the medial edges of the platysma helps define neck contour.
- **Platysmotomy**: Partial release of the platysma can be used to smooth platysmal bands and improve aesthetic result.

### The Digastric Muscle: Sculpting Deep Contour

The digastric muscle, located below the platysma, has a fundamental role in neck contour.

[Image: Illustration of digastric muscle]

- **Digastric shaving**: Reducing digastric muscle volume contributes to a more defined and elegant neck.

### The Cervical Fascia: The Safety Limit

The deep cervical fascia is a layer of connective tissue involving deep neck structures.

- **Fasciotomy**: Releasing the cervical fascia allows better tissue repositioning and contributes to a more natural result.

**Important**: The cervical fascia represents the safety limit. Crossing this barrier can lead to injuries of important nerves and vessels.

### The Marginal Mandibular Nerve: Essential Protection

The marginal mandibular nerve is a branch of the facial nerve controlling muscles responsible for lower lip expression. Injury to this nerve can lead to asymmetries and difficulties in speaking and eating.

- **Preservation**: It is fundamental to identify and protect the marginal nerve during surgery.
- **Protection techniques**: Avoiding deep dissections and excessive use of electrocautery near the nerve.

## Indications: Who is Modern Deep Neck For?

Modern Deep Neck is indicated for patients presenting:

- **Excess submental fat (double chin)**: Fat accumulation below the chin.
- **Loss of mandibular contour definition**: Lack of definition between neck and mandible.
- **Platysmal bands**: Presence of vertical cords in the neck.
- **"Heavy" or "full" neck**: General aspect of lack of definition and contour.

### Pre-Operative Evaluation: Planning Success

A detailed pre-operative evaluation is essential to determine the best approach for each patient. This evaluation should include:

- **Complete medical history**: To identify conditions that may increase surgical risk.
- **Detailed physical exam**: To evaluate neck anatomy and identify structures needing treatment.
- **Imaging tests (optional)**: In some cases, exams like ultrasound or MRI can be useful to evaluate deep fat and muscular anatomy.

## The Surgical Technique: Step-by-Step to Perfect Contour

Let's now detail the Modern Deep Neck surgical technique:

### 1. Incision

- **Submental incision**: Small incision below the chin, used to access deep neck structures.
- **Cervical incision**: Incision behind the ears, used to pull and fix the platysma.

### 2. Liposuction (Optional)

In some cases, gentle liposuction of superficial neck fat may be performed.

### 3. Platysma Treatment

- **Platysmotomy**: Release of inferior platysma insertions to allow its mobilization.
- **Platysmaplasty**: Suture of medial platysma edges to create muscular support for the neck.
- **Lateral Traction (Crevassi)**: Traction and fixation of the lateral portion of the platysma on the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) fascia to define mandibular contour.

### 4. Digastric Muscle Treatment

- **Digastric muscle identification**: Visualization of the digastric muscle after platysma dissection.
- **Partial digastric muscle resection (shaving)**: Removal of a portion of the digastric muscle to reduce volume in the region.
