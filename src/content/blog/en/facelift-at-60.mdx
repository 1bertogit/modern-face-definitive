## Is 60 Too Late?
**Definitely not.** The age range of 60 is actually one of the most common for
facelift. Most patients are between 55-65 years, when signs of aging become more pronounced
and motivation for change is strong.

## Advantages at This Age
### More Dramatic Result
Greater amount of tissue to correct = more visible result.
### Realistic Expectations
Patients tend to have more mature and realistic expectations.
### Availability for Recovery
Many already retired or with greater schedule flexibility.
## Special Care
- • **More rigorous cardiovascular assessment**
- • **Attention to comorbidities** (diabetes, hypertension)
- • **Medication review** (anticoagulants, etc.)
- • **Skin quality** — may require complementary techniques
- • **Recovery may be slower** — plan accordingly
## Does an Age Limit Exist?
There is no absolute age limit. What matters is **health status**, not the
number on ID. Patients 70+ in good shape can be excellent candidates, while a 55-year-old
patient with multiple comorbidities may not be.
### Age Is Just a Number
What matters is health and realistic expectations.
