## When to Start?
Facial lymphatic drainage is generally cleared between **7-14 days** after surgery,
depending on surgeon's assessment. Starting too early can cause complications.
## Proven Benefits
- • Faster edema reduction
- • Improved lymphatic circulation
- • Decreased bruising
- • Feeling of comfort
- • Possible improvement of initial fibrosis
## Important Precautions
- • Only with professional experienced in facial postoperative care
- • Gentle movements, without excessive pressure
- • Avoid suture areas until clearance
- • Communicate any discomfort to surgeon
