faq:
  - question: "Can men get a facelift?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Male demand for facial rejuvenation grows consistently. The technique is adapted to preserve masculine characteristics (angular jaw, horizontal eyebrows) and hide scars considering beard and hair."
  - question: "Is male facelift riskier?"
    answer: "There is higher risk of hematoma in men (2-3x more than women), probably due to greater vascularization of skin with beard. This requires doubled attention to hemostasis and BP control. Other risks are similar."
  - question: "How do scars look on men?"
    answer: "Incisions are adapted to remain hidden even with short hair or baldness. Pre-auricular incisions can be positioned more posteriorly. The retro-auricular region may be limited. Individual planning is essential."
  - question: "Does the result look natural on men?"
    answer: "Yes, when technique is adapted. The goal is to rejuvenate while maintaining masculine characteristics: defined jaw, horizontal eyebrow, without 'stretched' appearance. Vectors and tension are adjusted for the male pattern."
  - question: "Does beard interfere with facelift?"
    answer: "Beard influences planning. Hair can be transferred to pre-auricular areas if incisions are not well positioned. This requires technique adjustment. Patients with dense beard need specific planning."
  - question: "Does baldness contraindicate facelift?"
    answer: "It doesn't contraindicate, but influences technique. Scalp incisions may be visible in bald men. Alternatives include more anterior incisions, techniques with limited incisions or approaches that avoid the scalp."
  - question: "How long off work?"
    answer: "Similar to women: 10-14 days for social activities. Men frequently report concern about 'operated' appearance at work. Edema and ecchymosis follow similar timeline, but beard can help camouflage."
  - question: "Can I get a facelift and keep my beard?"
    answer: "Yes, but surgeon needs to consider beard area in planning. The goal is that scars don't interfere with beard growth or appearance. Detailed preoperative discussion is important."

## The Growing Male Demand
Facial rejuvenation is no longer exclusively female territory. Male demand grows
consistently, driven by competitiveness in the job market, cultural changes about male
self-care and normalization of aesthetic procedures for men.
However, male facelift is not simply "the same procedure on a man". There are important
anatomical, aesthetic and technical differences that the surgeon must know to deliver
natural results.

## Anatomical Differences Male vs Female

Aspect
Male
Female

Skin
Thicker, more vascularized
Thinner, less vascularized

Hair follicles
Abundant (beard) — more bleeding
Absent or fine on face

Jaw
More angular, prominent
More rounded, smooth

Eyebrow
Horizontal, lower
Arched, higher

Scalp
Frequently bald/thin
Generally dense

SMAS
Thicker and adherent
Thinner and mobile

## Technical Adaptations for Men
### 1. Incisions and Scars
Men have short hair or baldness, making it difficult to hide scalp scars.
Adaptations include:
- • More posterior pre-auricular incision (at tragus border)
- • Avoid or limit temporal incision in bald men
- • Limited retro-auricular incision
- • Consider techniques with minimal incisions
### 2. Beard and Hair
Beard area creates unique challenges:
- • Poorly positioned incisions can transfer hair into ear canal
- • Beard area on flap can create hair in anomalous location
- • Planning must consider if patient wears beard or not
- • Electrodepilation may be necessary secondarily
### 3. Reinforced Hemostasis
Higher risk of hematoma in men requires:
- • Strict BP control (target BP &lt;130/80)
- • Meticulous hemostasis during entire procedure
- • More liberal use of drains
- • Consider firmer compressive dressing
### 4. Masculine Vectors
Vectors must preserve masculine characteristics:
- • Maintain mandibular angularity
- • Avoid excessive eyebrow elevation
- • Preserve natural sulci (don't "smooth" too much)
- • More horizontal vector in lower third

## Expectations and Communication
Men frequently have different expectations and concerns from women:
### Common Concerns
- • "I don't want anyone to notice"
- • "I need to return to work quickly"
- • "I don't want to look feminine"
- • "My wife can't know" (yes, it happens)
- • "How long until training/playing golf?"
### Important Guidelines
- • Natural result is absolute priority
- • Social recovery: realistic 10-14 days
- • Intense exercise: 4-6 weeks
- • Beard can camouflage residual edema
- • Companion in post-op is mandatory
