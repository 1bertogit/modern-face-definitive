# Facial Fat and Aging: Complete Guide to Compartments

Facial fat is one of the pillars of youth and beauty. A young face is characterized by smooth contours, prominent cheekbones, and an overall appearance of fullness. Over the years, facial fat decreases, shifts, and loses its structure, resulting in sagging, wrinkles, and an aged appearance. Understanding the anatomy of facial fat and how it changes with age is crucial for effective facial rejuvenation.

This article explores the anatomy of facial fat compartments, how aging affects them, and which surgical and non-surgical techniques can restore lost volume and rejuvenate the face. Dr. Robério Brandão, creator of the Modern Face philosophy and specialist in minimally invasive facial rejuvenation techniques, shares his experience and vision on how to approach facial fat for natural and lasting results.

## What are Facial Fat Compartments?

Facial fat is not distributed evenly under the skin. Instead, it is organized into distinct compartments, separated by fibrous septa. These fat compartments act as "building blocks" giving volume, shape, and contour to the face.

[Image: Illustration of facial fat compartment anatomy, showing superficial and deep compartments.]

These compartments can be divided into two main groups:

*   **Superficial Fat Compartments:** Located just below the skin, these compartments are responsible for skin surface texture and appearance.
*   **Deep Fat Compartments:** Located in a deeper plane, these compartments provide structural support and volume to the face.

### Main Facial Fat Compartments

*   **Malar Fat Compartment:** Located in the cheek region, this compartment contributes to cheekbone projection and facial contour smoothness.
*   **Nasolabial Fat Compartment:** Located along the nasolabial fold (smile line), this compartment helps fill and smooth this area.
*   **Temporal Fat Compartment:** Located in the temple region, this compartment contributes to fullness and contour of the area around the eyes.
*   **Suborbital Fat Compartment:** Located below the eyes, this compartment helps smooth the transition between lower eyelid and cheek.
*   **Buccal Fat Pad (Bichat's Ball):** Located in the cheek region, this compartment can contribute to lower face fullness.
*   **Jaw Fat Compartments:** Located along the jaw, these compartments define the jawline contour.

## How Does Aging Affect Facial Fat?

Over the years, facial fat undergoes a series of changes contributing to an aged appearance:

*   **Volume Loss:** Fat compartments decrease in size, resulting in loss of facial volume and fullness.
*   **Displacement:** Gravity and loss of skin elasticity cause fat compartments to shift downwards, causing sagging and formation of creases and wrinkles.
*   **Loss of Structural Support:** Decrease in deep fat affects the face's structural support, leading to loss of definition and contour.
*   **Bone Resorption:** Bone resorption, especially in the jaw and maxilla, also contributes to loss of support and facial volume.

### Areas Most Affected by Fat Loss

*   **Malar Region (Cheeks):** Volume loss in this area results in less prominent cheekbones, drooping cheeks, and a flatter facial aspect.
*   **Temples:** Decrease in temporal fat causes hollowing in the area around the eyes, contributing to a skeletal appearance.
*   **Area Around Eyes:** Loss of suborbital fat accentuates dark circles and causes an abrupt transition between lower eyelid and cheek.
*   **Jaw:** Fat loss in the jaw results in loss of jawline definition and formation of "jowls".

## Techniques to Restore Facial Volume and Rejuvenate the Face

There are several surgical and non-surgical techniques that can be used to restore lost facial volume and rejuvenate the face:

### Non-Surgical Techniques

*   **Hyaluronic Acid Fillers:** Injectable fillers can be used to restore volume in specific areas, such as cheekbones, temples, and jaw.
*   **Collagen Biostimulators:** Substances like poly-L-lactic acid and calcium hydroxylapatite stimulate collagen production, improving skin firmness and volume over time.
*   **Botulinum Toxin (Botox):** Although it does not add volume directly, Botox can be used to relax facial muscles and smooth wrinkles, complementing other volume treatments.
*   **Radiofrequency and Microfocused Ultrasound:** These technologies can stimulate collagen and elastin production, improving skin firmness and providing a slight lifting effect.

### Surgical Techniques

*   **Fat Grafting:** Fat is removed from donor areas (such as abdomen or thighs), processed, and injected into areas of the face that have lost volume.
*   **Facial Implants:** Silicone or other material implants can be used to increase volume in specific areas, such as cheekbones or jaw.
*   **[Facelift](/en/blog/facelift-complete-guide) (Rhytidectomy):** Surgical facelift can reposition facial tissues, including fat, for a younger and more defined appearance.

## The Modern Face Philosophy and Facial Fat Treatment

Dr. Robério Brandão, creator of the Modern Face philosophy, adopts an individualized approach to facial fat treatment, combining surgical and non-surgical techniques to achieve natural and lasting results.

### Modern Face Principles in Facial Fat Treatment

*   **Prioritize Safety:** Patient safety is always the top priority. Minimally invasive and precise techniques are preferred to avoid complications.
*   **Natural Results:** The goal is to restore facial volume and contour subtly, avoiding a "stretched" or artificial appearance.
*   **Individualization:** Each patient is evaluated individually to determine the best techniques and approaches for their specific needs and goals.
*   **Facial Harmony:** Facial fat treatment is integrated into a holistic approach to facial rejuvenation, considering harmony between all face features.

### The Endomidface Technique and Facial Fat

The Endomidface technique, developed by Dr. Robério Brandão, is a minimally invasive approach for midface rejuvenation. This technique acts on malar and zygomatic fat compartments, restoring volume and contour lost with aging.

### How Endomidface Acts on Facial Fat

*   **Repositioning of Fat Compartments:** The Endomidface technique allows repositioning malar and zygomatic fat compartments, restoring cheekbone projection and smoothing the nasolabial fold.
*   **Improvement of Facial Contour:** By restoring facial volume and structural support, Endomidface improves facial contour and defines the jawline.
*   **Lasting Results:** Unlike injectable fillers, which need to be repeated periodically, Endomidface offers lasting results as it repositions facial tissues permanently.

## Relevant Anatomy for This Procedure

Anatomical knowledge is fundamental to understand how results are achieved safely and effectively.

### Key Structures

The face is composed of layers that must be understood together:

- **Skin**: most superficial layer, reflecting aging through wrinkles and laxity
- **Subcutaneous tissue**: contains fat that redistributes with age
- **SMAS (Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System)**: fundamental layer connecting muscles to skin
- **Facial muscles**: responsible for expression and dynamic support
- **Retaining ligaments**: anchor skin to facial skeleton
- **Facial nerves**: control movement and sensitivity

### Surgical Planes

In Modern Face philosophy, we work in specific planes:

- **Superficial plane**: above SMAS, used in less invasive procedures
- **Deep plane (sub-SMAS)**: below SMAS, allows more lasting results
- **Subcutaneous plane**: used for fat grafting and fat treatment

### Why This Matters

Understanding anatomy explains:

- Why certain procedures last longer than others
- How natural results are achieved
- Why surgeon experience is crucial
- How complications can be avoided

> "Respect for anatomy is what separates a natural result from an artificial one. In Modern Face, each structure has its role and must be preserved or repositioned with precision." — Dr. Robério Brandão
