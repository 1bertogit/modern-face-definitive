faq:
  - question: "Does facial fat decrease with age?"
    answer: "Yes and no. Some compartments atrophy (lose volume), especially in the periorbital and temporal regions. Others appear to 'increase' because they descend with gravity and accumulate in lower areas. It's a combination of loss and redistribution."
  - question: "What causes deep nasolabial folds?"
    answer: "The fold itself is a normal anatomical structure. It deepens when malar fat descends over it (creating the 'fold') and when there's volume loss in the region. It's ptosis + deflation combined."
  - question: "Does bichectomy help with rejuvenation?"
    answer: "Controversial. Removing Bichat's fat pad can thin the young face but accelerate aging. Buccal fat provides structural support. Many surgeons are cautious with bichectomy in patients who will undergo facelift in the future."
  - question: "Do fillers replace lost fat?"
    answer: "Partially. Fillers add volume where it was lost, but don't reposition ptosed fat. It's a solution for deflation, not ptosis. That's why fillers and facelift are complementary, not competitors."
  - question: "Does facelift remove facial fat?"
    answer: "Generally not. Modern facelift repositions fat, doesn't remove it. Removing facial fat can create a skeletonized appearance. Exceptions include submental liposuction when there's real excess fat in the neck."
  - question: "Why do some people age more than others?"
    answer: "Genetics determines much: bone structure, skin quality, fat distribution pattern. Environmental factors (sun, tobacco) accelerate. People with strong bone structure and good skin elasticity often age better."

## Beyond "Volume Loss"
"Volume loss" is an oversimplification. Facial aging involves complex fat
redistribution: some compartments atrophy, others descend, some appear to increase
because they accumulate fat from upper areas.
Facial fat is organized in **compartments separated by fibrous septa**.
Each compartment ages differently. Understanding this anatomy is fundamental for
effective interventions.
> "You cannot treat 'facial fat' — you need to treat each compartment specifically. Malar
> fat needs to be elevated. Jowl fat needs to be redistributed. These are different
> approaches."

## The Main Fat Compartments
### Location:
In aging:
In surgery:


## Aging Patterns by Region
### Upper Third
- • **Temporal fat:** Significant atrophy → hollow temples
- • **Retro-orbicular fat:** May herniate → eyelid bags
- • General trend: deflation
### Middle Third
- • **Malar fat:** Descends → nasolabial fold
- • **SOOF:** Atrophy + ptosis → palpebromalar groove
- • Trend: ptosis + combined deflation
### Lower Third
- • **Jowl fat:** Accumulates ptosed fat
- • **Nasolabial fat:** Descends laterally
- • Trend: accumulation of descended fat
### Neck
- • **Submental fat:** May increase or descend
- • **Subplatysmal fat:** Less affected by age
- • Trend: accumulation + combined laxity

## Surgical Implications
#### Reposition, Don't Remove
The modern paradigm is to reposition ptosed fat, not remove it. Excessive removal
creates a skeletonized appearance that worsens over time.
#### Treatment by Compartment
Each compartment requires a specific approach: elevation, redistribution, or volume
supplementation (autologous fat or filler).
#### Combination with Volumization
Where there's real atrophy (temples, periorbital), adding volume may be necessary
beyond lifting. Lipofilling or fillers are options.
