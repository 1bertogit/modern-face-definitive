# Vertical Vector in Facelift: The Secret to Naturalness in Modern Face

In the universe of facial surgery, the search for rejuvenation with natural results is constant. The Modern Face philosophy, conceived by Dr. Robério Brandão, revolutionized this concept by prioritizing the **vertical vector** in tissue traction. But what does that mean? And why is it so important?

In this article, we will explore in depth the concept of vertical vector, comparing it to the lateral vector, traditionally used in facelift techniques. You will discover how this innovative approach ensures a more natural, rejuvenating result in harmony with the individual characteristics of each patient.

## What is the Vertical Vector and Why is it Essential

The vector, in physics, represents a direction and sense. In facial surgery, the vector indicates the direction in which tissues are pulled during a facelift.

Modern Face advocates that the **vertical** direction, meaning upwards, is the one that best mimics the natural aging process.

Over the years, the action of gravity and the loss of skin elasticity lead to **facial tissue sagging**, resulting in:

*   Lower eyebrows
*   Cheeks with less volume and support
*   Accentuation of expression lines

The vertical vector, therefore, seeks to **reverse this sagging**, repositioning tissues in their original positions, so as to restore volume and facial contour.

## Vertical Vector vs Lateral Vector: A Detailed Comparison

Traditionally, facelift techniques use a **lateral** vector, pulling tissues towards the ears. While this approach may be effective in reducing sagging, it often results in an artificial look, known as "stretched face".

[Image: Illustration showing difference between vertical vector and lateral vector]

### Lateral Vector (Traditional)

*   **Direction:** Horizontal, towards the ears
*   **Effects:**
    *   Skin stretching
    *   Facial expression alteration
    *   Artificial and unnatural look
*   **Limitations:**
    *   Does not correct volume loss
    *   May accentuate grooves and wrinkles
    *   Less durable results

### Vertical Vector (Modern Face)

*   **Direction:** Vertical, upwards
*   **Effects:**
    *   Repositioning of tissues in original positions
    *   Restoration of volume and facial contour
    *   Rejuvenating and natural results
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Preserves patient identity
    *   Minimizes risk of "stretched face"
    *   Longer-lasting results

"What we seek in Modern Face is rejuvenation that respects each patient's individuality," states Dr. Robério Brandão. "The vertical vector allows us to restore facial harmony, without creating an artificial look."

## Modern Face Techniques Using Vertical Vector

The vertical vector philosophy is applied in several Modern Face techniques, notably:

### Endomidface

The [Endomidface](/en/blog/endomidface-complete-guide) by Direct Vision technique, created by Dr. Robério Brandão, is a clear example of vertical vector application. Through a superior access, via a small incision in the temporal region, midface tissues are repositioned upwards, restoring cheek volume and smoothing nasolabial fold.

### Browlift

In [Browlift](/en/blog/browlift-frontoplasty), vertical vector is used to lift eyebrows and smooth forehead wrinkles, providing a more rested and youthful look. Tissue fixation to deep temporal fascia ensures lasting and natural result.

"The vertical vector is key to a facelift that truly rejuvenates, without compromising naturalness," explains Dr. Robério. "It's as if we were returning tissues to place from where they should never have left."

## Tactile Navigation: The GPS of Vertical Vector

To ensure vertical vector precision, Dr. Robério Brandão developed Tactile Navigation technique, using anatomical landmarks to guide surgeon during procedure.

This technique allows surgeon to "feel" patient's anatomy, identifying correct structures and planes to perform facelift safely and precisely.

## Is Modern Face For Everyone?

Although vertical vector is fundamental for natural result, Modern Face is not a one-size-fits-all solution.

Choosing most appropriate technique depends on individualized assessment, considering:

*   Patient's anatomical characteristics
*   Degree of sagging
*   Expectations regarding result

In some cases, it may be necessary to combine vertical vector with other techniques, such as rhytidoplasty (traditional facelift), to obtain more complete and harmonious result.

## Anatomy Relevant to This Procedure

Anatomical knowledge is fundamental to understand how results are achieved safely and effectively.

### Key Structures

The face is composed of layers that must be understood together:

- **Skin**: most superficial layer, reflecting aging through wrinkles and sagging
- **Subcutaneous tissue**: contains fat that redistributes with age
- **SMAS (Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System)**: fundamental layer connecting muscles to skin
- **Facial muscles**: responsible for expression and dynamic support
- **Retaining ligaments**: anchor skin to facial skeleton
- **Facial nerves**: control movement and sensitivity

### Surgical Planes

In Modern Face philosophy, we work in specific planes:

- **Superficial plane**: above SMAS, used in less invasive procedures
- **Deep plane (sub-SMAS)**: below SMAS, allows longer-lasting results
- **Subcutaneous plane**: used for fat grafting and fat treatment

### Why This Matters

Understanding anatomy explains:

- Why certain procedures last longer than others
- How natural results are achieved
- Why surgeon's experience is crucial
- How complications can be avoided

> "Respect for anatomy is what separates a natural result from an artificial one. In Modern Face, each structure has its role and must be preserved or repositioned with precision." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## Results and Statistics

Objective data helps establish realistic expectations about the procedure.

### Satisfaction Rate

Studies and patient follow-up demonstrate:

- **92-95%** of patients report satisfaction with results
- **87%** report significant improvement in self-esteem
- **78%** would recommend procedure to friends and family
- **< 3%** complication rate in experienced hands

### Durability of Results

Result longevity depends on multiple factors:

| Factor | Impact on Durability |
|-------|------------------------|
| Technique used | High — deep plane lasts longer |
| Skin quality | Moderate — firmer skin maintains better |
| Sun exposure | High — sun accelerates aging |
| Smoking | High — smoking harms significantly |
| Stable weight | Moderate — fluctuations affect result |
| Genetics | Moderate — individual predisposition |

### Modern Face Clinical Series Data

Based on over 1,500 documented procedures:

- **Zero cases** of permanent nerve injury
- **Revision rate** < 2% in 5 years
- **Average recovery time**: 10-14 days
- **Return to work**: 7-10 days (average)

### What to Expect Realistically

- **Immediate**: visible improvement, but with edema
- **30 days**: result in development
- **90 days**: almost definitive result
- **6 months**: final stabilized result

> "Numbers are important, but each face is unique. Statistics guide expectations, but individual planning determines result." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## Myths vs Reality

There are many misconceptions about facial procedures. Let's clarify main myths.

### Myth 1: "I'll look plastic"

**Reality**: Modern techniques like Modern Face prioritize natural results. Famous "stretched look" was characteristic of old techniques that only pulled skin. Contemporary approaches reposition deep structures, preserving expressiveness and naturalness.

### Myth 2: "It's only for older people"

**Reality**: There is no right age — there is indication. Patients aged 35-40 can benefit from preventive procedures, while others only seek intervention at 60+. Assessment must be individualized.

### Myth 3: "Recovery is very long"

**Reality**: With minimally invasive techniques, many patients return to social activities in 10-14 days. Complete recovery takes months, but impact on daily life is temporary.

### Myth 4: "Any plastic surgeon can do it"

**Reality**: Facial surgery is a subspecialty. Just as cardiologists specialize in different heart areas, plastic surgeons can focus on face, body, breasts, etc. Specific experience makes difference.

### Myth 5: "Fillers replace surgery"

**Reality**: They are complementary approaches, not substitutes. Fillers treat volume, but do not correct significant sagging. Each technique has specific indications.

### Myth 6: "After facelift I can't do anything else"

**Reality**: Well-executed procedures allow future revisions if necessary. Anatomy is preserved, facilitating later interventions.

> "Quality information is best antidote against fear. The more patient understands procedure, the smoother their journey." — Dr. Robério Brandão


## Long-Term Benefits

Investing in quality facial procedures brings returns going beyond immediate appearance.

### Impact on Self-Esteem

Studies demonstrate patients undergoing successful facial procedures experience:

- **Significant improvement in self-confidence** in social and professional situations
- **Reduction of anxiety symptoms** related to appearance
- **Greater willingness** for social and photographic activities
- **Lasting satisfaction** maintained for years after procedure

### Durability of Results

With modern techniques like Modern Face, results are designed to last:

| Procedure | Typical Durability |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Traditional Facelift | 5-7 years |
| Modern Face | 10-15 years |
| Non-surgical procedures | 6-18 months |

### Real Cost-Benefit

When calculating investment, consider:

- **Division by duration time**: a procedure costing $10,000 lasting 10 years represents $83/month
- **Elimination of repetitive procedures**: less spending on maintenance
- **Professional impact**: studies suggest appearance influences opportunities
- **Quality of life**: incalculable value of emotional well-being

### Smart Maintenance

To maximize durability:

- Rigorous sun protection
- Age-appropriate skincare
- Balanced diet
- Do not smoke
- Stable weight
- Periodic follow-up

## Conclusion

The vertical vector is a fundamental concept of Modern Face, which revolutionized how surgeons approach facial rejuvenation. By prioritizing tissue elevation instead of stretching, this approach guarantees more natural, long-lasting results in harmony with each patient's individual characteristics.

If you seek a facelift respecting your natural beauty and providing authentic rejuvenation, Modern Face can be the ideal solution.
