## Primary Indications
Direct Vision Endomidface is especially effective when the main problem is in the **midface** — the region between the lower eyelids and nasolabial fold.


## Ideal Patient Profile
### The ideal candidate typically presents:
- • Age between 45-65 years (most common range)
- • Good general health
- • Realistic result expectations
- • Main complaint in the midface
- • Availability for 7-10 days recovery
- • Non-smoker or willing to quit
## Special Cases
### Faces with Previous Biostimulators
Unlike traditional techniques, Direct Vision Endomidface is **especially indicated** for faces that have received Sculptra, Radiesse or other biostimulators. Direct vision
allows safe navigation around fibrosed areas.
### Complement to Deep Neck
When the patient presents aging in both midface and neck, Endomidface combines
perfectly with Deep Neck, offering complete facial rejuvenation in a single surgical
time.
### After Previous Blepharoplasty
Patients who have had blepharoplasty and now present malar ptosis are excellent
candidates. Endomidface corrects midface descent without needing to reapproach the
eyelids.
## Limitations and Contraindications
### Endomidface is NOT indicated for:
- • **Isolated jowls** — requires complementary approach
- • **Isolated cervical laxity** — Deep Neck indicated
- • **Severe skin excess** — may require additional excision
- 
• **Unrealistic expectations** — does not replace knowing limitations
- • **Uncontrolled coagulopathies**
- • **Active facial infections**
