faq:
  - question: "How much does a facelift cost in the US?"
    answer: "Values vary significantly: $15,000 to $50,000+ depending on technique, extent, location and surgeon experience. Isolated endomidface tends to be lower range; combined procedures (face + neck) in upper range."
  - question: "What's included in the facelift price?"
    answer: "Typically: surgeon fees, team, operating room, anesthesia, materials, compression garment and postoperative consultations. Preoperative tests and medications are usually extra. Always ask for itemized quote."
  - question: "Can I finance a facelift?"
    answer: "Many surgeons offer financing. Options include: credit card (up to 12x), specialized medical financing, or direct payment plan with surgeon. Interest rates vary — compare."
  - question: "Is a cheap facelift reliable?"
    answer: "Beware of prices far below market. Facial surgery requires experience, adequate facility and quality materials. Excessive savings may mean cuts in safety. Cheap can become very expensive."
  - question: "Comparing with fillers over the years, does facelift pay off?"
    answer: "Often yes. Regular fillers (2-4x/year for 10 years) can cost $50,000-120,000+ accumulated. A facelift lasting 8-12 years may have better long-term cost-benefit, plus structural result."
  - question: "Is facelift covered by insurance?"
    answer: "Aesthetic facelift is not covered by public or private insurance. Reconstructive procedures (post-trauma, cancer) may be covered. Check with your insurance provider."
  - question: "How to know if the investment is worth it for me?"
    answer: "Consider: impact on self-esteem and quality of life, result duration vs repetitive treatments, your financial situation, and if you're a suitable candidate. Consultation with experienced surgeon helps clarify."

## An Honest Conversation About Money
Let's talk about the elephant in the room: facelift is a significant investment. There's
no way around it. But "expensive" is relative — it depends on what you're comparing, how
long results last, and the impact on your life.
This article presents transparent cost analysis, without hiding values or creating false
expectations. The decision is yours — our role is to provide clear information.

## Comparison: Facelift vs Fillers (10 Years)
Fair comparison considers accumulated cost over time:

Scenario (10 years)
Total Cost
Note

Moderate filler
$50,000 - $75,000
2-3 syringes/year, $2-3k/session

Filler + biostimulators
$75,000 - $120,000
Treatment combination

Single facelift
$25,000 - $42,000
8-12 year result

Facelift + light maintenance
$35,000 - $55,000
Facelift + occasional filler

Math often favors facelift when there's surgical indication. But not every patient needs
surgery — choice should be based on anatomy, not just cost.

## Value Beyond Money
Cost-benefit isn't just financial. Consider:
#### Time
Fillers require regular visits (4-6x/year). Facelift is single procedure with
lasting result.
#### Structural Result
Facelift corrects ptosis. Filler only camouflages. They're qualitatively different
results.
#### Self-esteem and Quality of Life
Hard to quantify, but impact on confidence and wellbeing can be significant.
#### Peace of Mind
Not worrying about "when will I need to do it again" has value.

## Warning Signs: When to Be Suspicious
### 🚩 Be suspicious of:
- • Prices far below market (may have safety cuts)
- • Lack of transparency about what's included
- • Pressure to decide quickly ("special today only")
- • Surgeon who doesn't show previous cases
- • Inadequate or improvised facility
- • Promises of guaranteed or "perfect" result
