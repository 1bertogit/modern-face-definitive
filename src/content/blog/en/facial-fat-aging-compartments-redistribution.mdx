# Facial Fat and Aging: Complete Guide on Compartments and Redistribution

Facial fat plays a crucial role in the youthful and healthy appearance of the face. Over the years, the distribution and volume of this fat change, contributing significantly to visible signs of aging. Understanding the anatomy of facial fat, its compartments, and how it redistributes with age is fundamental for effective and natural facial rejuvenation. This article thoroughly explores the dynamics of facial fat and how the [Modern Face](/en/blog/modern-face-concept-philosophy) philosophy addresses redistribution to restore facial harmony and contour.

## What Are Facial Fat Compartments?

[Image: Diagram showing the different superficial and deep facial fat compartments]

Facial fat is not distributed uniformly but organized into distinct areas called **facial fat compartments**. These compartments are separated by fibrous septa, acting as support structures. This compartmentalized organization contributes to the characteristic volume and contour of a young face.

### Superficial Compartments

Located just below the skin, these compartments are responsible for the definition and smoothness of facial contours. Some of the main superficial compartments include:

*   **Malar Compartment:** Responsible for cheek volume.
*   **Nasolabial Compartment:** Located around the nose and lips.
*   **Labial Compartment:** Contributes to lip volume and shape.
*   **Palpebral Compartment:** Influences lower eyelid contour.

### Deep Compartments

Situated below facial muscles, deep compartments provide structural support and underlying volume. Important compartments include:

*   **Deep Temporal Compartment:** Located in the temporal region, influencing forehead and temple contour.
*   **Buccal Compartment:** Situated in the cheek region, below the buccinator muscle.
*   **Suborbicularis Oculi Fac (SOOF) Compartment:** Located below the orbicularis oculi muscle, contributing to lower eyelid support.

## How Does Facial Fat Change With Aging?

With aging, facial fat undergoes several changes contributing to an aged appearance. These changes include:

### Atrophy of Superficial Compartments

Superficial fat compartments, such as malar and labial, tend to lose volume with age. This atrophy leads to:

*   Loss of cheek projection.
*   Accentuation of the nasolabial fold (expression lines running from nose to mouth corner).
*   Decrease in lip volume.
*   Appearance of "dark circles" due to loss of lower eyelid support.

### Hypertrophy and Descent of Deep Compartments

While superficial compartments atrophy, deep compartments can paradoxically increase in size and undergo downward displacement. This hypertrophy and descent contribute to:

*   Formation of "jowls" (drooping cheeks along the jawline).
*   Accentuation of double chin due to submental fat accumulation.
*   Loss of jawline definition.

### Bone and Ligament Changes

Besides fat changes, aging also affects bone structure and facial [ligaments](/en/blog/retaining-ligaments). Bone resorption and ligament weakening contribute to soft tissue support loss, including fat, accelerating sagging and laxity.

## What is Facial Fat Redistribution?

**Facial fat redistribution** is a surgical technique aiming to restore facial volume and contour by repositioning fat from excess areas to deficiency areas. This technique can involve:

*   **Liposuction:** Removal of fat from areas like double chin or cheeks.
*   **Fat Grafting:** Injection of removed fat into areas like cheeks, temples, or lips to restore lost volume.
*   **Compartment Repositioning:** More advanced surgical techniques involving elevation and fixation of fat compartments in higher and more youthful positions.

### Benefits of Facial Fat Redistribution

When performed by an experienced surgeon, facial fat redistribution can provide remarkable and lasting results, including:

*   Restoration of cheek volume and projection.
*   Smoothing of nasolabial fold.
*   Improvement of jaw contour.
*   Rejuvenation of eye region.
*   Younger and more rested appearance.

## The Modern Face Approach to Facial Fat

[Video: Dr. Robério's explanation on Modern Face approach to facial fat and aging]

The **Modern Face** philosophy, created by Dr. Robério Brandão, emphasizes the importance of a deep understanding of facial anatomy and aging dynamics for effective and natural rejuvenation. In Modern Face, the approach to facial fat is guided by the following principles:

### Understanding Compartmentalized Anatomy

Modern Face prioritizes detailed knowledge of facial fat compartments, their locations, volumes, and how they change with age. This understanding allows the surgeon to plan redistribution precisely and personally, addressing each patient's specific needs.

### Prioritization of Deep Planes

Modern Face values work in deep planes, below facial muscles, to obtain more structural and lasting results. This may involve elevating and fixing deep fat compartments in higher positions, restoring underlying support to soft tissues.

### Minimally Invasive Techniques

Modern Face seeks to minimize surgical aggression, using minimally invasive techniques whenever possible. This may include using thin cannulas for liposuction and fat grafting, as well as surgical approaches preserving surrounding tissue integrity.

### Natural and Harmonious Results

The ultimate goal of Modern Face is to create results that look natural and harmonious, without evident signs of surgical intervention. This requires an individualized approach, considering each patient's unique facial characteristics and aesthetic expectations.

### Dr. Robério Brandão's Vision

Dr. Robério Brandão, creator of the Modern Face philosophy, emphasizes the importance of facial rejuvenation respecting each patient's anatomy and individuality. He believes facial fat redistribution, when performed with precision and skill, can provide remarkable and lasting results, restoring facial harmony and contour naturally.

> "Modern Face is not just about stretching skin, but understanding the underlying structure and repositioning tissues to create a result that looks natural and young," states Dr. Robério Brandão.

## Risks and Considerations

Like any surgical procedure, facial fat redistribution presents potential risks, including:

*   Nerve injuries.
*   Asymmetries.
*   Contour irregularities.
*   Fat necrosis (death of fat cells).
*   Infection.
*   Reabsorption of grafted fat.

It is crucial to choose an experienced and qualified plastic surgeon who has deep knowledge of facial anatomy and involved surgical techniques. Additionally, it is important to discuss procedure risks and benefits in detail with the surgeon before making a decision.

## Relevant Anatomy for This Procedure

Anatomical knowledge is fundamental to understand how results are achieved safely and effectively.

### Key Structures

The face is composed of layers that must be understood together:

- **Skin**: most superficial layer, reflecting aging through wrinkles and laxity
- **Subcutaneous tissue**: contains fat that redistributes with age
- **SMAS (Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System)**: fundamental layer connecting muscles to skin
- **Facial muscles**: responsible for expression and dynamic support
- **Retaining ligaments**: anchor skin to facial skeleton
- **Facial nerves**: control movement and sensitivity

### Surgical Planes

In Modern Face philosophy, we work in specific planes:

- **Superficial plane**: above SMAS, used in less invasive procedures
- **Deep plane (sub-SMAS)**: below SMAS, allows more lasting results
- **Subcutaneous plane**: used for fat grafting and fat treatment

### Why This Matters

Understanding anatomy explains:

- Why certain procedures last longer than others
- How natural results are achieved
- Why surgeon experience is crucial
- How complications can be avoided

> "Respect for anatomy is what separates a natural result from an artificial one. In Modern Face, each structure has its role and must be preserved or repositioned with precision." — Dr. Robério Brandão

> "Numbers are important, but every face is unique. Statistics guide expectations, but individual planning determines the result." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## Post-Operative Care Details

Procedure success depends as much on surgical technique as on post-operative care.

### First Days: Critical Phase

In this phase, small cares make big difference:

- **Elevated rest**: keep head elevated at 30-45° even when sleeping
- **Cold compresses**: apply in first 48h to reduce edema
- **Rigorous medication**: follow exactly prescribed schedules
- **Light diet**: prefer soft foods and avoid excessive chewing
- **Abundant hydration**: water helps in tissue recovery

### First Week: Intermediate Care

As healing advances:

- **Careful hygiene**: clean area as directed, without rubbing
- **Avoid sun exposure**: use hat and sunscreen when necessary to go out
- **Gentle facial movements**: avoid exaggerated expressions
- **Adequate sleep**: body recovers mainly during sleep
- **Avoid alcohol and tobacco**: both harm healing

### Weeks 2-4: Gradual Return

Return to activities should be progressive:

- **Light activities**: short walks are allowed
- **Remote work**: can be resumed as per comfort
- **Light makeup**: generally allowed after 2 weeks
- **Moderate exercises**: only with medical clearance
- **Lymphatic drainage**: indicated to accelerate recovery

### What to Avoid

During entire recovery period:

- Direct sun exposure on operated areas
- Intense physical activities before clearance
- Alcohol consumption in first 2 weeks
- Smoking (ideally stop 4 weeks before and after)
- Non-prescribed anti-inflammatories
- Sudden movements with face
