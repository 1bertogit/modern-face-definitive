## Documented Emotional Benefits
Studies show that patients satisfied with facelift report improvement in self-esteem,
social confidence, and quality of life. Our [Modern Face concept is built around these holistic benefits. The feeling of "looking as good as you feel" is validating.
- • Greater confidence in social situations
- • Reduction of appearance-related anxiety
- • Feeling of alignment between felt age and appearance
- • Willingness to take better care of oneself (cascade effect)
## Realistic Expectations
Facelift improves appearance, it doesn't solve relationship, career, or deep life
dissatisfaction problems. It's important to have clarity about what surgery can and cannot
do.
## When to Worry
Patients with body dysmorphia (distorted self-perception) or who expect surgery to solve
non-aesthetic problems may not benefit and should be carefully evaluated.
