faq:
  - question: "How long does it take to recover from facelift?"
    answer: "Initial recovery (visible edema and bruising) takes 10-14 days. Most patients return to social activities in 2-3 weeks. Final result stabilizes in 3-6 months when residual edema completely resolves and tissues settle."
  - question: "Does facelift hurt a lot?"
    answer: "Surprisingly, discomfort is usually less than patients expect. Predominant sensation is tightness and numbness, not acute pain. Common analgesics are usually sufficient. Modern Face technique with minimal dissection tends to have even less discomfort."
  - question: "When can I return to work after facelift?"
    answer: "Depends on type of work. Remote/home office: 5-7 days. In-person work with social contact: 10-14 days. Intensive physical work: 3-4 weeks. These timelines may vary per procedure extent and individual healing."
  - question: "When can I exercise after facelift?"
    answer: "Light walks: 7 days. Moderate exercise (no impact): 3 weeks. Complete gym and high-impact exercise: 4-6 weeks. Increased blood pressure during exercise can cause bleeding in first days."
  - question: "Is numbness normal after facelift?"
    answer: "Yes, absolutely normal. Numbness occurs because small sensory nerves are cut during dissection. Sensitivity returns gradually over 3-6 months. Numbness persisting beyond 12 months is rare."
  - question: "Can I sleep on my side after facelift?"
    answer: "Sleeping with head elevated (30-45°) recommended in first 7-10 days to reduce edema. Side sleeping can be gradually resumed after 2 weeks. Avoid pressure on operated areas first 14 days."
  - question: "When do scars become imperceptible?"
    answer: "Scars go through phases: red/pink (1-3 months), maturing to white (6-12 months). Well-positioned scars (in natural creases and scalp) become virtually imperceptible after 6-12 months in most patients."
  - question: "Can I use makeup after facelift?"
    answer: "Makeup can be applied after suture removal and initial incision healing (usually 10-14 days). Avoid makeup directly on incisions first 2-3 weeks. Use hypoallergenic products initially."

## Understanding Recovery
Facelift recovery follows a predictable pattern, although each patient has individual
variations. This guide presents the **typical timeline** based on Dr. Robério
Brandão's experience with over 1,500 facial surgeries.
A crucial point: **recovery is not linear**. It's common to look "worse" on
days 2-3 than day 1 (edema peak). Many patients worry at this phase, especially those
who had combined [Endomidface and Deep Neck procedures, but it's completely normal.
### ⚠️ Realistic Expectation
Final facelift result takes 3-6 months to stabilize. Judgments in first weeks are
premature. Patience and trust in the process are essential.

Tip:


## Common Concerns (and Why Not to Worry)
### "I'm too swollen!"
Edema on days 2-4 can be impressive, but it's temporary and expected. It's the body
starting the healing process. Significant resolution occurs in 7-10 days.
### "My face is asymmetric!"
Edema asymmetry is common and expected. One side may swell more than the other. This
doesn't mean result will be asymmetric. Wait for complete edema resolution before
assessing symmetry.
### "I can't feel part of my face!"
Numbness is absolutely normal after facelift. Small sensory nerves are cut during
dissection. Sensitivity returns gradually over 3-6 months. Patience.
### "The scars are red!"
Scars go through red/pink phase in first 1-3 months. This is normal part of healing.
They lighten gradually. Sun protection is important at this phase.
### "The result isn't what I expected!"
Assessments in first weeks are premature. Edema distorts appearance. Real result can
only be evaluated after 3-6 months. If still dissatisfied after this period, talk to
your surgeon.

## Tips for Optimized Recovery
### ✅ Do
- • Keep head elevated 30-45° (10 days)
- • Apply cold compresses as instructed
- • Take medications at prescribed times
- • Walk lightly from day 4-5
- • Light diet and abundant hydration
- • Use sun protection after healing
- • Attend scheduled follow-ups
### ❌ Avoid
- • Lower head (increases edema)
- • Physical exercise first 3 weeks
- • Direct sun exposure on incisions
- • Alcohol (increases edema and bleeding)
- • Smoking (compromises healing)
- • Aspirin and unauthorized anti-inflammatories
- • Assess result before 3 months
