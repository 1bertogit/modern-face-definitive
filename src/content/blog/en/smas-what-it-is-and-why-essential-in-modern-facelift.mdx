# SMAS: What It Is and Why It Is Fundamental in Modern Facelift

The Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System, better known as SMAS, is a key structure in facial anatomy and a central point for the success of any facelift seeking long-lasting and natural results. Ignoring the SMAS is like building a house without solid foundations: the structure may look good at first, but it will inevitably collapse over time.

In this article, we will explore in depth what the SMAS is, its precise location, its importance in the aging process, and how modern facelift techniques, such as the Modern Face philosophy and the [Endomidface](/en/blog/endomidface-complete-guide) by Direct Vision technique, address this crucial structure to provide complete and long-lasting facial rejuvenation.

## Understanding SMAS Anatomy

The SMAS is a continuous fibromuscular layer that extends across the entire face, from the temporal region to the neck. It is located below the subcutaneous fat and above the facial muscles, interconnecting these structures and acting as a support system for the skin and soft tissues of the face.

### Components of SMAS

The SMAS is not a homogeneous structure, but rather a complex system composed of different elements:

*   **Fascia:** A layer of dense connective tissue that surrounds facial muscles.
*   **Muscles:** The muscles of facial expression, responsible for facial expressions.
*   **Fat:** Fat compartments found within and around the SMAS, contributing to facial volume and contour.
*   **Ligaments:** Fibrous structures that connect the SMAS to the facial skeleton, providing support and stability.

### The Importance of Continuity

A fundamental characteristic of the SMAS is its continuity. It is not a series of isolated structures, but rather an interconnected system that functions as a unit. This continuity allows the SMAS to distribute tension and force across the entire face, providing uniform support and sustenance.

## Aging and SMAS: An Inevitable Connection

Over the years, the SMAS undergoes changes that contribute to facial aging. These changes include:

*   **Loss of elasticity:** Collagen and elastin fibers in the SMAS degrade, resulting in loss of firmness and elasticity.
*   **Muscle atrophy:** Facial muscles lose volume and strength, decreasing support to the SMAS.
*   **Fat redistribution:** Facial fat compartments undergo changes in size and position, leading to volume loss in some areas and accumulation in others.
*   **Ligament attenuation:** Ligaments connecting the SMAS to the facial skeleton stretch and weaken, decreasing structural support.

### Visible Consequences of SMAS Aging

These changes in the SMAS result in visible signs of facial aging, such as:

*   **Skin sagging:** Loss of SMAS support leads to skin sagging and the formation of wrinkles and expression lines.
*   **Cheek sagging:** Gravity pulls facial tissues downward, resulting in sagging cheeks and loss of jawline definition.
*   **Accentuation of nasolabial fold:** Sagging facial tissues contribute to the deepening of the nasolabial fold (the "smile lines").
*   **Loss of jawline definition:** SMAS flaccidity and soft tissue sagging obscure the jawline, resulting in a less defined facial contour.

## Facelift and SMAS: An Essential Approach

Facelift, also known as rhytidoplasty, is a surgical procedure aimed at reversing signs of facial aging. Modern facelift techniques recognize the importance of the SMAS and address it directly to provide longer-lasting and more natural results.

### Traditional Techniques vs. Modern Approaches

*   **Traditional Techniques:** Early facelift techniques focused only on removing excess skin, without treating the SMAS. These procedures resulted in superficial and short-lived results, with a high risk of sagging recurrence.
*   **Modern Approaches:** Modern facelift techniques recognize the need to act on the SMAS to provide more effective and long-lasting results. These approaches aim to mobilize, reposition, and fix the SMAS, restoring the structural support of the face.

### Common Approaches to SMAS in Facelift

There are several surgical techniques to address the SMAS in facelift, including:

*   **SMAS plication:** Involves folding and suturing the SMAS to shorten and strengthen the layer.
*   **SMASectomy:** Removes a portion of the SMAS, allowing the edges to be sutured and tightened.
*   **Deep plane facelift:** Releases the SMAS and underlying tissues in a deep plane, allowing for broader and more natural repositioning.

### Modern Face and SMAS: A Philosophy of Balance

In the Modern Face philosophy, created by Dr. Robério Brandão, the SMAS is treated with deep respect for anatomy and with the goal of achieving natural and long-lasting results. The [Endomidface](/en/blog/endomidface-complete-guide) technique, one of the pillars of Modern Face, exemplifies this approach.

> *"Modern Face is not just about stretching the skin. It's about understanding the SMAS and repositioning tissues to restore the face's natural harmony."* - Dr. Robério Brandão

## Endomidface by Direct Vision: An Innovative Approach to SMAS

[Endomidface](/en/blog/endomidface-complete-guide) by Direct Vision is a minimally invasive facelift technique focusing on repositioning the SMAS to rejuvenate the midface. Developed by Dr. Robério Brandão, this technique offers several advantages over traditional approaches.

### Strategic Access to SMAS

Instead of making large incisions and extensive detachments, Endomidface by Direct Vision uses small incisions in the temporal region, allowing access to the SMAS through a minimally invasive tunnel.

### SMAS Repositioning

Once accessed, the SMAS is carefully repositioned to restore facial volume and contour. This is done through sutures and other fixation techniques that ensure long-term result stability.

### Direct Vision: Precision and Safety

One of the distinctive features of Endomidface by Direct Vision is the use of an endoscope to visualize the SMAS during the procedure. This allows the surgeon to have a clear and precise view of anatomical structures, minimizing the risk of damage to nerves and blood vessels. Dr. Robério even nicknames this technique "video without video".

### Natural and Long-Lasting Results

By acting directly on the SMAS, Endomidface by Direct Vision provides more natural and long-lasting results than techniques limited to skin removal. SMAS repositioning restores the structural support of the face, reversing signs of aging effectively and harmoniously.

> *"The secret to a good lift is not stretching the skin, but repositioning the SMAS to restore facial volume and harmony."* - Dr. Robério Brandão

## Optimized Recovery and Minimal Risks

In addition to providing superior results, Endomidface by Direct Vision also offers a shorter recovery time and a lower risk of complications compared to traditional facelift techniques.

### Faster Recovery

Smaller incisions and limited detachment result in less edema and bruising, allowing patients to return to their normal activities within a shorter period.

### Minimal Risks

Endoscopic visualization and technique precision minimize the risk of damage to nerves and blood vessels, ensuring patient safety.

With over 1,500 facial surgeries performed and 212 documented Endomidface cases, Dr. Robério Brandão has vast experience and a proven track record of safe and effective results.

## Anatomy Relevant to This Procedure

Anatomical knowledge is fundamental to understanding how results are achieved safely and effectively.

### Key Structures

The face is composed of layers that must be understood together:

- **Skin**: the most superficial layer, reflecting aging through wrinkles and sagging
- **Subcutaneous tissue**: contains fat that redistributes with age
- **SMAS (Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System)**: fundamental layer connecting muscles to skin
- **Facial muscles**: responsible for expression and dynamic support
- **Retaining ligaments**: anchor skin to facial skeleton
- **Facial nerves**: control movement and sensitivity

### Surgical Planes

In Modern Face philosophy, we work in specific planes:

- **Superficial plane**: above the SMAS, used in less invasive procedures
- **Deep plane (sub-SMAS)**: below the SMAS, allows for longer-lasting results
- **Subcutaneous plane**: used for fat grafting and fat treatment

### Why This Matters

Understanding anatomy explains:

- Why certain procedures last longer than others
- How natural results are achieved
- Why surgeon experience is crucial
- How complications can be avoided

> "Respect for anatomy is what separates a natural result from an artificial one. In Modern Face, each structure has its role and must be preserved or repositioned with precision." — Dr. Robério Brandão
