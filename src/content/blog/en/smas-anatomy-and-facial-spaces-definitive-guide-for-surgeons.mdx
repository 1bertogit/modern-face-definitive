# SMAS Anatomy and Facial Spaces: The Definitive Guide for Safe Surgery

Modern facial surgery requires deep knowledge of anatomy, especially the Superficial Musculo-Aponeurotic System (SMAS) and facial spaces. This comprehensive guide, based on Dr. Robério Brandão's Modern Face philosophy, offers a detailed view of these crucial structures to ensure safe, effective, and natural-looking results.

Understanding SMAS anatomy and facial spaces is not just a matter of technical knowledge, but the foundation for surgery that respects the natural structure of the face and minimizes risks. Prepare to deepen your knowledge and elevate your surgical practice to a new level.

## What is the SMAS and Why is it Important?

The Superficial Musculo-Aponeurotic System (SMAS) is a continuous fibro-muscular layer that extends across the entire face. It plays a crucial role in facial support and expression, acting as a "net" that connects facial muscles to the skin.

The importance of the SMAS in facial surgery lies in its ability to allow for deeper and longer-lasting tissue repositioning. Unlike techniques that act only on the skin, manipulating the SMAS allows for a more natural and harmonious result, correcting sagging and restoring volume lost with aging.

### SMAS Anatomy

The anatomy of the SMAS varies in different areas of the face:
- **Temporal Region:** The SMAS fuses with the superficial temporal fascia.
- **Zygomatic Region:** The SMAS connects to the zygomatic ligaments.
- **Cheek Region:** The SMAS extends as a distinct layer over the facial muscles.
- **Neck:** The SMAS continues with the platysma, a thin, superficial muscle covering the neck.

### Mobile SMAS vs Fixed SMAS: A Crucial Distinction

In the Modern Face philosophy, it is fundamental to distinguish between mobile SMAS and fixed SMAS:

- **Mobile SMAS:** Located in the anterior region of the face, allows greater tissue mobility.
- **Fixed SMAS:** Located in the lateral region of the face, near the ear, is more adhered to bony structures and has less mobility.

This distinction is crucial, especially in the era of biostimulators, as most of these products are injected into the fixed SMAS, creating a zone of fibrosis that can make surgical dissection difficult. The [Endomidface](/en/blog/endomidface-complete-guide) technique, developed by Dr. Robério Brandão, bypasses this zone of fibrosis, accessing the mobile SMAS safely and effectively.

## Facial Spaces: Navigating Anatomy with Precision

In addition to the SMAS, facial spaces play a fundamental role in facial surgery. They are areas of loose tissue that allow for tissue gliding and progression of surgical dissection.

### Main Facial Spaces

- **Pre-Septal Space:** Located between the orbital septum and orbicularis oculi muscle, important for eyelid surgery.
- **Pre-Zygomatic Space:** Located over the zygomatic bone, crucial for midface lifting.
- **Pre-Maxillary Space:** Located over the maxilla, important for treating the nasolabial fold.
- **Buccal Space:** Located in the cheek, allows access to the Bichat's fat pad and other soft tissues.

### The Importance of Facial Spaces in Surgery

Understanding the location and extent of facial spaces allows the surgeon to:
- **Perform precise and safe dissection:** Avoiding damage to nerves, blood vessels, and other noble structures.
- **Mobilize tissues effectively:** Facilitating repositioning and facial support.
- **Optimize surgical results:** Creating a more harmonious and natural facial contour.

## Retaining Ligaments: The Key to Facial Support

Retaining ligaments are fibrous structures that connect the skin and soft tissues of the face to the bony skeleton. They play a crucial role in facial support, resisting gravity and maintaining facial structure.

### Main Retaining Ligaments

- **Zygomatic Ligaments:** Located over the zygomatic bone, support the malar region (cheeks).
- **Orbitomalar Ligaments:** Located around the orbit, support the lower eyelid and malar region.
- **Masseteric Ligaments:** Located over the masseter muscle, support the jaw region.
- **Mandibular Ligament:** Stabilizes the chin region.

### The Importance of Retaining Ligaments in Surgery

In facial surgery, retaining ligaments can be:
- **Released:** To allow greater tissue mobilization and more effective repositioning.
- **Bypassed:** Preserving their support function and avoiding damage to noble structures.

The decision to release or bypass retaining ligaments depends on the surgical technique used and the patient's goals. In the Modern Face philosophy, the priority is always to minimize risks and optimize results, adapting the technique to each patient's individual needs.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What is the difference between SMASectomy and Deep Plane?

SMASectomy involves removing a portion of the SMAS, while Deep Plane involves dissection in a deeper plane, below the SMAS, allowing for greater tissue mobilization.

### How does Modern Face approach the submandibular gland?

Modern Face prioritizes preserving the submandibular gland, avoiding its removal or direct manipulation. Instead, suspension and contouring techniques are used to improve neck aesthetics.

### What are the risks of nerve injury in SMAS surgery?

The main nerves at risk are branches of the facial nerve, which innervate facial expression muscles. Careful dissection and precise anatomical knowledge are fundamental to avoid injury.

### How does Modern Face deal with fibrosis caused by biostimulators?

The Endomidface by Direct Vision technique accesses the mobile SMAS anteriorly, bypassing the fibrosis zone in the lateral fixed SMAS, minimizing the risk of complications.

### What is the recovery time after SMAS surgery?

Recovery time varies depending on the extent of surgery and individual patient characteristics. generally, Modern Face seeks to optimize recovery, minimizing surgical trauma and using minimally invasive techniques.

## Relevant Anatomy for This Procedure

Anatomical knowledge is fundamental to understand how results are achieved safely and effectively.

### Key Structures

The face is composed of layers that must be understood together:

- **Skin**: the most superficial layer, reflecting aging through wrinkles and sagging
- **Subcutaneous tissue**: contains fat that redistributes with age
- **SMAS (Superficial Musculo-Aponeurotic System)**: fundamental layer connecting muscles to skin
- **Facial muscles**: responsible for expression and dynamic support
- **Retaining ligaments**: anchor skin to the facial skeleton
- **Facial nerves**: control movement and sensation

### Surgical Planes

In the Modern Face philosophy, we work in specific planes:

- **Superficial plane**: above the SMAS, used in less invasive procedures
- **Deep plane (sub-SMAS)**: below the SMAS, allows for longer-lasting results
- **Subcutaneous plane**: used for fat grafting and fat treatment

### Why This Matters

Understanding anatomy explains:

- Why certain procedures last longer than others
- How natural results are achieved
- Why the surgeon's experience is crucial
- How complications can be avoided

> "Respect for anatomy is what separates a natural result from an artificial one. In Modern Face, every structure has its role and must be preserved or repositioned with precision." — Dr. Robério Brandão
