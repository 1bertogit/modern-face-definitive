faq:
  - question: "Do I need to be a plastic surgeon to join the mentorship?"
    answer: "The programs are primarily designed for plastic surgeons. However, otolaryngologists and head and neck surgeons with experience in facial surgery may also apply. Each case is evaluated individually to ensure the participant has an adequate foundation."
  - question: "Is the mentorship in-person or online?"
    answer: "The programs are online, with recorded lectures, support materials, and live case discussion sessions with Dr. Robério Brandão. This format allows surgeons from anywhere in the world to participate without interrupting their practices. Real-time interaction occurs during weekly sessions."
  - question: "How long does it take to master the technique?"
    answer: "The Endomidface mentorship lasts 2 months, but complete mastery depends on practice. After 10-15 supervised cases, most surgeons achieve autonomy. The Legacy Combo (6 months) offers extended follow-up for consolidation. The learning curve is gentler than endoscopic techniques."
  - question: "What is the financial investment?"
    answer: "Endomidface Mentorship: $3,200 USD (2 months). Deep Neck Mentorship: $3,000 USD (2 months). Legacy Combo: $5,800 USD (6 months, includes both + extended follow-up). Installment plans available. Considering a single surgery can generate $6,000-10,000 USD, the ROI is extremely fast."
  - question: "Do I receive a certificate upon completion?"
    answer: "Yes. Upon completing the program with active participation in sessions and case discussions, you receive a certificate from the Modern Face Institute attesting to your training in Modern Face techniques with Dr. Robério Brandão."
  - question: "Can I continue asking questions after the mentorship?"
    answer: "Yes. Students who complete the program have access to the alumni group, where they can discuss cases, ask questions, and exchange experiences. Additionally, Dr. Robério maintains a direct channel for specific questions about complex cases."
  - question: "Is the technique applicable in any infrastructure?"
    answer: "Yes, this is one of the greatest advantages. Endomidface doesn't require endoscopic equipment ($100,000-$150,000). You only need surgical loupes and headlight — equipment most surgeons already have or can acquire for a fraction of the cost."
  - question: "How many cases do I need to feel comfortable?"
    answer: "Most surgeons report comfort after 10-15 cases. During the mentorship, you discuss your initial cases with Dr. Robério, receiving specific feedback that accelerates the learning curve. Some students operate during the mentorship and bring cases for discussion."

## Why Learn Modern Face?
If you're a plastic surgeon or facial surgeon, you've probably noticed: **patients have changed**. Most people seeking facial rejuvenation today have already received fillers,
biostimulators, or both. The "classic face" from textbooks is now the exception.
Traditional techniques — developed for virgin tissue — often encounter difficulties in
this new context. Altered planes, unexpected fibrosis, unpredictable adhesions. [Modern Face® was specifically developed for this reality.
### ✅ Benefits of Mastering Modern Face
- • **Equipment independence:** No $100,000+ endoscopic towers
- 
• **Superior safety:** Subperiosteal plane protects the facial nerve
- 
• **Contemporary patients:** Ideal technique for those who've had injectables
- 
• **Optimized recovery:** Local anesthesia, less edema, quick return
- • **Competitive advantage:** Few surgeons master the technique
- • **Fast ROI:** One surgery pays for the mentorship investment

## The Journey from Beginner to Expert
The path to mastering Modern Face techniques is structured in progressive phases:

## Learning Curve: What to Expect
One of the great advantages of Endomidface over traditional endoscopic techniques is the **gentler learning curve**. You don't need to learn to operate looking at a monitor — you use your existing
direct vision skills.
