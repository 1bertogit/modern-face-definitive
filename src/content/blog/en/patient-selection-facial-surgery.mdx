faq:
  - question: "What is the ideal age for facelift?"
    answer: "There is no fixed 'ideal' age. Indication depends on degree of aging, not chronological age. Typically, candidates are between 45-70 years. Younger patients with premature aging or older patients in good health may be candidates. Evaluation is individual."
  - question: "Does excess weight contraindicate facelift?"
    answer: "Very high BMI (&gt;35) can compromise results and increase surgical risks. Ideally, patients should be close to stable weight before surgery. Weight fluctuations after surgery can affect result longevity."
  - question: "Is smoking an absolute contraindication?"
    answer: "Active smoking significantly increases complication risks (skin necrosis, poor healing). Cessation recommended at least 4-6 weeks before and after surgery. Some surgeons consider it absolute contraindication; others operate with risk counseling."
  - question: "Can I have facelift if I have diabetes?"
    answer: "Controlled diabetes is not an absolute contraindication, but increases infection and poor healing risks. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) should be controlled (&lt;7-8%). Preoperative evaluation with metabolic control is essential."
  - question: "Does history of keloids contraindicate facelift?"
    answer: "Keloid tendency is concerning, but not absolute contraindication. Incisions are positioned in low-risk areas (scalp, natural folds). Frank discussion about scarring risks is necessary. Prevention protocols can be implemented."
  - question: "Unrealistic expectations: how to identify?"
    answer: "Warning signs: bringing another person's photo as 'goal', dissatisfaction with well-executed previous surgeries, multiple appearance complaints, seeking surgery due to third-party pressure. In-depth conversations and reflection period help identify."

## Why Is Patient Selection So Important?
Perfect surgical technique applied to the wrong patient produces poor results. On the
other hand, adequate technique on the right patient produces remarkable transformations.
Patient selection is probably the most important — and most neglected — factor in facial
surgery success.
This includes not only medical aspects (general health, anatomy), but also psychological
(expectations, motivations) and practical (recovery availability, postoperative
support).

## The Ideal Candidate
For [Modern Face techniques, the ideal candidate typically presents:

Note that not all criteria need to be perfect. Evaluation is holistic — compensations
can be made in some areas if others are particularly favorable.

## Red Flags: Psychological Warning Signs
Beyond medical contraindications, there are warning signs suggesting the patient may not
be an appropriate candidate regardless of their anatomy:
#### 🚩 Another person's photo as "goal"
Patient bringing celebrity or other person's photo saying "I want to look like this"
may have unrealistic expectations or dysmorphia.
#### 🚩 Multiple surgeries with dissatisfaction
History of several cosmetic surgeries with persistent dissatisfaction suggests the
problem may not be surgical.
#### 🚩 Third-party pressure
Patient coming due to partner, family or social media pressure rarely satisfied.
Motivation must be internal.
#### 🚩 Specific event as trigger
"Want to do before wedding/divorce/promotion" may indicate transient emotional
motivation. Reflection period recommended.
#### 🚩 Disproportionate complaints
Patient seeing minimal flaws as severe may have body dysmorphic disorder.
Psychological referral before surgery.
Identifying these signs requires in-depth conversations, multiple consultations when
necessary, and willingness to refuse surgery when indicated.

## Systematic Assessment: The SPE-M System
Modern Face Institute developed the **SPE-M** system for standardized facial
surgery candidate evaluation:
#### S — Skin
Quality, elasticity, photoaging, thickness. Impacts technique choice and prognosis.
#### P — Ptosis
Degree and location of ptosis. Midface? Lower? Cervical? Defines necessary
technique.
#### E — Bone Structure
Malar projection, mandibular angle, chin. Defines the "canvas" we work on.
#### M — Musculature/Mimic
Platysmal hypertonia, bands, dynamic asymmetries. Influences functional and
aesthetic result.
SPE-M evaluation is taught in detail in Modern Face Institute mentorship programs.
