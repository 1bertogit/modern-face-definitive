# Patient Selection for Facial Surgery: The Definitive Guide

Facial surgery is a transformative journey, but success depends crucially on the careful choice of candidates. It is not just about surgical technique, but aligning expectations, assessing risks, and understanding the individual needs of each patient.

This article, based on the [Modern Face](/en/blog/modern-face-concept-philosophy) philosophy and Dr. Robério Brandão's vast experience, offers a complete guide to patient selection, covering from initial evaluation to post-operative care.

## Initial Evaluation: Face, Body, and Mind

The first consultation is a crucial moment to establish a relationship of trust and align expectations.

### Facial Analysis: Anatomy and Aging

A detailed analysis of facial structure is essential to determine the most appropriate technique.

*   **Bone structure:** Assess chin projection, jaw angle, and facial symmetry.
*   **Skin quality:** Observe elasticity, texture, and presence of spots or scars.
*   **Fat distribution:** Identify areas of volume accumulation and loss.
*   **Facial mimicry:** Analyze expression at rest and during speech.

### General Health Assessment: Zero Risk

Patient safety is the top priority.

*   **Complete medical history:** Investigate pre-existing diseases, allergies, and medications in use.
*   **Laboratory tests:** Request blood tests, cardiological evaluation, and other specific exams as needed.
*   **Habits:** Ask about smoking, alcohol consumption, and drug use.

### Psychological Evaluation: Realistic Expectations

Modern Face seeks natural and harmonious results, and the patient's mental health is fundamental to the procedure's success.

*   **Motivations:** Understand the reasons leading the patient to seek surgery.
*   **Expectations:** Align patient expectations with possible results.
*   **Body image:** Assess the patient's perception of their own image.
*   **Social support:** Investigate the patient's support network during the recovery period.

## Ideal Candidates: Who Benefits Most?

Not all patients are ideal candidates for facial surgery. Careful choice is fundamental to optimize results and minimize risks.

### Midface Sagging: Endomidface as a Solution

Endomidface, a technique created by Dr. Robério, is especially effective for patients with:

*   **Cheek sagging:** Malar fat pad descent and loss of facial contour definition.
*   **Nasolabial folds:** Accentuation of lines extending from nose to mouth corner.
*   **Lower eyelids:** Vertical lengthening and support loss.

### Aged Neck: [Deep Neck](/en/blog/deep-neck-complete-guide) to Harmonize

Deep Neck, a neck rejuvenation technique, is indicated for patients with:

*   **Excess fat:** Fat accumulation under the chin and in the cervical region.
*   **Muscle sagging:** Loss of platysma muscle tone, resulting in vertical neck bands.
*   **Loss of definition:** Disappearance of the angle between chin and neck.

### Tired Look: Brow Lift to Revitalize

Brow Lift, or forehead lift, is ideal for patients with:

*   **Drooping eyebrows:** Eyebrow ptosis, resulting in a sad and aged look.
*   **Excess skin:** Excess skin on the upper eyelid, hindering vision.
*   **Forehead wrinkles:** Expression lines on the forehead and between eyebrows.

### Modern Face: Integral Harmonization

In many cases, combining techniques is the key to a natural and long-lasting result.

"Modern Face is about orchestrating different techniques to create a symphony of rejuvenation," states Dr. Robério Brandão.

## Contraindications: When to Say No

In some cases, facial surgery is not recommended. It is fundamental to identify these situations to protect the patient's health and well-being.

### Health Problems: Prioritizing Safety

*   **Uncontrolled diseases:** Diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic conditions must be under control before surgery.
*   **Coagulation disorders:** Increase the risk of bleeding and hematomas.
*   **Autoimmune diseases:** May compromise healing.

### Harmful Habits: Demanding Commitment

*   **Smoking:** Interferes with blood circulation and impairs healing. It is essential to stop smoking at least 30 days before surgery.
*   **Excessive alcohol use:** Can increase the risk of complications.

### Unrealistic Expectations: Aligning Desires and Results

*   **Body dysmorphia:** Mental disorder characterized by excessive concern with appearance defects.
*   **Unattainable expectations:** Desire to rejuvenate decades or completely transform appearance.

"Facial surgery can improve appearance, but it cannot change a person's life," warns Dr. Robério Brandão.

## Pre-Operative Preparation: The Path to Success

Proper preparation is fundamental to ensure a safe procedure and satisfactory results.

### Exams: Confirming Fitness

*   **Blood tests:** Assess general patient health and identify possible coagulation problems.
*   **Cardiological evaluation:** Check heart health and identify risks of cardiovascular complications.
*   **Facial ultrasound:** Map facial anatomy and identify areas of fibrosis or injectable accumulation.

### Skin Care: Optimizing Healing

*   **Suspend product use:** Stop using acids, retinoids, and other irritating products a few weeks before surgery.
*   **Hydration:** Keep skin well hydrated to improve elasticity and healing.

### Lifestyle: Adopting Healthy Habits

*   **Nutrition:** Follow a balanced diet rich in nutrients to strengthen the immune system and promote healing.
*   **Physical activity:** Maintain a light exercise routine to improve blood circulation and reduce stress.

## Post-Operative: Caring for the Result

The recovery period is as important as the surgery itself. Following medical guidelines is fundamental to ensure a long-lasting result and minimize complications.

### Essential Cares: Protecting Healing

*   **Rest:** Avoid physical exertion and activities that may increase blood pressure.
*   **Dressings:** Follow medical guidelines for changing and cleaning dressings.
*   **Medication:** Take prescribed medications to relieve pain and prevent infections.

### Medical Follow-up: Monitoring Evolution

*   **Return visits:** Attend all follow-up appointments so the doctor can monitor healing and identify possible complications.
*   **Lymphatic drainage:** Perform lymphatic drainage sessions to reduce swelling and accelerate recovery.

### Healthy Habits: Preserving Youth

*   **Sun protection:** Use sunscreen daily to protect skin from sun damage.
*   **Nutrition:** Follow a balanced diet rich in antioxidants to fight aging.
*   **Exercise:** Maintain an exercise routine to strengthen facial muscles and improve blood circulation.

## Essential Questions in Consultation

A well-utilized consultation is fundamental for procedure success. Prepare yourself with right questions.

### About Surgeon's Experience

1. **"How many procedures similar to my case have you performed?"** — Case volume is experience indicator
2. **"Can I see before and after photos of patients with characteristics similar to mine?"** — Real results are best reference
3. **"What is your specific training in facial surgery?"** — Specialization makes difference in results

### About Proposed Technique

4. **"Why do you recommend this specific technique for my case?"** — Understand clinical reasoning
5. **"What are the alternatives and why is this best option?"** — Compare approaches
6. **"Where will scars be and how do they evolve over time?"** — Realistic expectations

### About Risks and Recovery

7. **"What are most common risks and how are they managed?"** — Transparency is essential
8. **"How long will I be away from normal activities?"** — Adequate planning
9. **"What type of anesthesia will be used?"** — Anesthetic safety
10. **"What is post-operative follow-up protocol?"** — Continuous support

### Signs of Good Surgeon

- Answers your doubts clearly and patiently
- Shows real results from previous cases
- Discusses risks transparently
- Does not promise unrealistic results
- Has adequate team and structure

## Post-Operative Warning Signs

Knowing warning signs allows early identification of any complication and quick action.

### When to Seek Surgeon Immediately

Some signs require urgent medical evaluation:

- **Active bleeding** that does not cease with light compression for 10-15 minutes
- **Fever** above 38°C, especially if accompanied by chills
- **Intense and sudden pain** not controlled with prescribed medication
- **Abrupt asymmetry** — much larger swelling on one side may indicate hematoma
- **Skin color change** — paleness or darkening in specific areas
- **Purulent discharge** with unpleasant odor

### Normal Signs (Do Not Worry)

These symptoms are expected and do not require concern:

- **Moderate edema** in first days, especially in morning
- **Ecchymosis** (purple spots) that change color progressively
- **Temporary tingling or numbness** in operated area
- **Pulling sensation** as tissues heal
- **Small temporary asymmetries** due to irregular edema
- **Difficulty smiling** or moving face in first days

### Safety Protocol

In case of doubt, follow this protocol:

1. **Document** — take photos and note symptoms
2. **Contact** — call surgeon's team
3. **Do not self-medicate** — avoid non-prescribed medications
4. **Keep calm** — most complications are manageable

> "In Modern Face, each patient receives a direct communication channel for emergencies. Safety is not luxury, is priority." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## Detailed Post-Operative Care

Procedure success depends as much on surgical technique as on post-operative care.

### First Days: Critical Phase

In this phase, small cares make big difference:

- **Elevated rest**: keep head elevated at 30-45° even when sleeping
- **Cold compresses**: apply in first 48h to reduce edema
- **Rigorous medication**: follow exactly prescribed schedules
- **Light diet**: prefer soft foods and avoid excessive chewing
- **Abundant hydration**: water helps in tissue recovery

### First Week: Intermediate Care

As healing advances:

- **Careful hygiene**: clean area as directed, without rubbing
- **Avoid sun exposure**: use hat and sunscreen when necessary to go out
- **Gentle facial movements**: avoid exaggerated expressions
- **Adequate sleep**: body recovers mainly during sleep
- **Avoid alcohol and tobacco**: both harm healing

### Weeks 2-4: Gradual Return

Return to activities should be progressive:

- **Light activities**: short walks are allowed
- **Remote work**: can be resumed as per comfort
- **Light makeup**: generally allowed after 2 weeks
- **Moderate exercises**: only with medical clearance
- **Lymphatic drainage**: indicated to accelerate recovery

### What to Avoid

During entire recovery period:

- Direct sun exposure on operated areas
- Intense physical activities before clearance
- Alcohol consumption in first 2 weeks
- Smoking (ideally stop 4 weeks before and after)
- Non-prescribed anti-inflammatories
- Sudden movements with face

## Results and Statistics

Objective data helps establish realistic expectations about the procedure.

### Satisfaction Rate

Studies and patient follow-up demonstrate:

- **92-95%** of patients report satisfaction with results
- **87%** report significant improvement in self-esteem
- **78%** would recommend procedure to friends and family
- **< 3%** complication rate in experienced hands

### Durability of Results

Result longevity depends on multiple factors:

| Factor | Impact on Durability |
|-------|------------------------|
| Technique used | High — deep plane lasts longer |
| Skin quality | Moderate — firmer skin maintains better |
| Sun exposure | High — sun accelerates aging |
| Smoking | High — smoking harms significantly |
| Stable weight | Moderate — fluctuations affect result |
| Genetics | Moderate — individual predisposition |

### Modern Face Clinical Series Data

Based on over 1,500 documented procedures:

- **Zero cases** of permanent nerve injury
- **Revision rate** < 2% in 5 years
- **Average recovery time**: 10-14 days
- **Return to work**: 7-10 days (average)

### What to Expect Realistically

- **Immediate**: visible improvement, but with edema
- **30 days**: result in development
- **90 days**: almost definitive result
- **6 months**: final stabilized result

> "Numbers are important, but each face is unique. Statistics guide expectations, but individual planning determines result." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## Myths vs Reality

There are many misconceptions about facial procedures. Let's clarify main myths.

### Myth 1: "I'll look plastic"

**Reality**: Modern techniques like Modern Face prioritize natural results. The famous "stretched look" was characteristic of old techniques that only pulled skin. Contemporary approaches reposition deep structures, preserving expressiveness and naturalness.

### Myth 2: "It's only for older people"

**Reality**: There is no right age — there is indication. Patients aged 35-40 can benefit from preventive procedures, while others only seek intervention at 60+. Evaluation must be individualized.

### Myth 3: "Recovery is very long"

**Reality**: With minimally invasive techniques, many patients return to social activities in 10-14 days. Complete recovery takes months, but impact on daily life is temporary.

### Myth 4: "Any plastic surgeon can do it"

**Reality**: Facial surgery is a subspecialty. Just as cardiologists specialize in different heart areas, plastic surgeons may focus on face, body, breasts, etc. Specific experience makes difference.

### Myth 5: "Fillers replace surgery"

**Reality**: They are complementary approaches, not substitutes. Fillers treat volume, but do not correct significant sagging. Each technique has specific indications.

### Myth 6: "After lift I can't do anything else"

**Reality**: Well-executed procedures allow future revisions if necessary. Anatomy is preserved, facilitating later interventions.

> "Quality information is best antidote against fear. The more patient understands procedure, the smoother their journey." — Dr. Robério Brandão

Patient selection for facial surgery is an art combining technical knowledge, empathy, and deep understanding of each individual's needs and expectations.
