faq:
  - question: "Is it possible to do a facelift on a face that has used biostimulators?"
    answer: "Yes, it is possible and safe with the right technique. Endomidface by Direct Vision was specifically developed to allow safe surgery on faces that have been treated with biostimulators like Sculptra, Radiesse, or Ellansé."
  - question: "How long should I wait after biostimulator to do a facelift?"
    answer: "It's recommended to wait for the peak of fibrosis (generally 6-12 months after application) so that anatomical planes are more defined. After this period, direct vision surgery allows safe navigation around fibrosed areas."
  - question: "Do biostimulators need to be removed before surgery?"
    answer: "No. One of the advantages of the Direct Vision technique is allowing the surgeon to identify and work around areas of biostimulator without needing removal. The material remains where it is, and surgery works in the available anatomical spaces."
  - question: "Why are traditional techniques risky on injected faces?"
    answer: "Traditional techniques like Deep Plane were developed for 'virgin' faces. In faces fibrosed by biostimulators, traditional anatomical planes may no longer exist, increasing risk of nerve injury and bleeding."
  - question: "Which biostimulator causes the most surgical difficulty?"
    answer: "Polycaprolactone (Ellansé) tends to create more intense fibrosis. Poly-L-lactic acid (Sculptra) and calcium hydroxyapatite (Radiesse) also create significant fibrosis, especially when applied in large volumes or repeated sessions."
  - question: "Was Modern Face created because of biostimulators?"
    answer: "Partly, yes. The observation that 90% of patients seeking facial surgery have already used some type of biostimulator was crucial for developing a safer technique for this population."

## The New Normal: Treated Faces
20 years ago, patients came to facial surgery with "virgin" faces — never treated with
minimally invasive aesthetic procedures. Today, this reality has changed drastically.
### 📊 Clinical Reality Data
- 
• **90%** of patients seeking facelift have already used biostimulators
- • **75%** have had multiple treatment sessions
- • **60%** combined different types of products
- • Average age for starting treatments: **35-40 years**
This means facial surgeons need to know how to operate on faces that **no longer have virgin anatomy**. The question is not "if" you'll encounter fibrosis — it's "where" and "how much".
> "Refusing patients because they have biostimulators means refusing 90% of current demand.
> The answer is not to refuse — it's to adapt the technique."

## Why Do Biostimulators Complicate Surgery?
Biostimulators work by stimulating collagen production. This collagen creates **tissue fibrosis** — scar tissue that permanently alters local anatomy.
### Poly-L-Lactic Acid (Sculptra)
Creates diffuse fibrosis in treated areas. Multiple sessions = cumulative fibrosis.
Peak fibrosis: 6-12 months
### Calcium Hydroxyapatite (Radiesse)
More localized but intense fibrosis. Microspheres may be palpable.
Peak fibrosis: 3-6 months
### Polycaprolactone (Ellansé)
Most intense and lasting fibrosis. Can create "blocks" of scar tissue.
Fibrosis: can last years
### Hyaluronic Acid
Less fibrosis, but high volume can compress structures. Can be dissolved.
Duration: 12-18 months
### ⚠️ Risks in Traditional Techniques
- 
• **Altered anatomical planes** — traditional surgical plane may not exist
- • **"Trapped" nerves** — fibrosis can involve nerve branches
- • **Increased bleeding** — fibrosed tissue is more vascularized
- 
• **Difficult dissection** — loss of tactile feedback in blind techniques
- 
• **Unpredictable results** — tissue responds differently to traction

## The Solution: Direct Vision on Injected Face
**Endomidface by Direct Vision** solves the central problem: unpredictability.
When you **see and feel**
simultaneously, you can adapt the technique to the real conditions of each patient. This approach
is detailed in our [Endomidface section.
### ✓ Visual Identification of Fibrosis
Under direct vision, fibrosed areas are visually identifiable — they have a whiter
color, different texture and increased consistency. The surgeon can literally see
where the problem is.
### ✓ Simultaneous Tactile Feedback
While visualizing, the surgeon feels tissue resistance. Fibrosis offers different
resistance from normal tissue — this allows adjusting force and direction of
dissection in real time.
### ✓ Adaptive Navigation
Instead of following a predetermined plane (which may not exist), the surgeon
navigates through spaces that effectively exist in that specific face. Each surgery is
personalized to the altered anatomy.
### ✓ Preservation of Structures
Nerves, vessels and other critical structures are identified before being approached.
If a nerve is involved in fibrosis, it's possible to see and bypass it safely.

## Practical Protocol: Modern Face Approach
### 1. Detailed History
Identify **all** previous treatments: product type, volume, number of sessions,
approximate dates, treated areas.
### 2. Clinical Mapping
Careful palpation to identify fibrosis areas. Mark zones of greatest consistency in
preoperative planning.
### 3. Adequate Timing
Ideally, operate after peak fibrosis (6-12 months after last application) when planes
have already been defined.
### 4. Direct Vision Technique
Dissection under direct visualization, identifying and bypassing fibrosed areas. Use
of available planes, not theoretical planes.
### 5. Realistic Expectations
Explain that treated faces may have slightly different results from virgin faces — but
still excellent.

## Results on Injected Faces
Of the 212 documented cases in Dr. Robério Brandão's series, a significant percentage were
patients with previous biostimulators. Results demonstrate that it's possible to:
0%
Permanent Nerve Injury
7-10d
Social Recovery
These numbers are especially significant because they include exactly the population that
other techniques consider "high risk" or even contraindicated.
