## The Importance of Asking
The evaluation consultation is a two-way street. The surgeon evaluates if you are a
candidate, but you must also evaluate if he is the right professional for you. Direct
and specific questions about techniques like [Endomidface or Deep Neck help in this decision.
Don't be ashamed to ask. Experienced and confident surgeons **like** informed
patients who ask good questions. If a surgeon gets irritated with legitimate questions, that's
a warning sign.
