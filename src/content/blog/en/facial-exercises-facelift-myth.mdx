## What Do Facial Exercises Promise?
"Face yoga" or "facial gymnastics" programs promise to tone facial muscles, reduce
wrinkles and create natural lifting effect. The theory is that exercising facial muscles
would create support.
## The Anatomical Problem
Facial aging is NOT caused by weak muscles. It's caused by processes that only
structural interventions like [Endomidface or Deep Neck can truly address:
- • **Fat ptosis** — fat descends by gravity
- • **Bone resorption** — facial skeleton shrinks
- • **Collagen loss** — skin loses elasticity
- • **Ligament laxity** — ligaments weaken
Exercising muscles doesn't reverse any of these processes.
## They Can Even Worsen
Repetitive muscle contractions can, paradoxically, deepen dynamic wrinkles (like forehead
and crow's feet) — exactly the opposite of desired.
