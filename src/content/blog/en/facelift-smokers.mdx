## Why Is Smoking a Problem?
Nicotine causes **vasoconstriction** — narrowing of blood vessels. In facelift,
where circulation of undermined skin is critical, this can lead to serious complications like
flap necrosis. This is why we prioritize techniques that preserve as much vascularization as
possible, such as [Endomidface.
### Increased risks in smokers:
- • **Skin necrosis** — 12x higher risk
- • **Suture dehiscence** — 3x higher risk
- • **Infection** — 2x higher risk
- • **Hematoma** — increased risk
- • **Poor healing**
## How Long to Stop Smoking?
### Modern Face® Recommendation:
- **Before surgery:** Minimum 4-6 weeks without smoking
- **After surgery:** Minimum 4 weeks without smoking
- **Ideal:** Definitive cessation
**Important:** This includes e-cigarettes, vapes, nicotine patches and any form
of nicotine. The problem is the substance, not just the cigarette.
## Can I Get a Facelift If I Smoke?
**Yes, as long as you stop adequately.** Surgery is not contraindicated for smokers
— it's contraindicated for those actively smoking. With adequate cessation, risks return close
to normal.
