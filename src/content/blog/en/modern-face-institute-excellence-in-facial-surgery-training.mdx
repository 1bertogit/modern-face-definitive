# Modern Face Institute: Excellence Training in Facial Surgery

The search for excellence in facial surgery inevitably involves robust and updated training. The **Modern Face Institute**, conceived by the renowned Dr. Robério Brandão, emerges as a beacon in this scenario, offering a structured path for surgeons who aim to master the most innovative and safe techniques on the market.

With the **Modern Face** philosophy as a pillar, the institute stands out for its approach focused on natural results, optimized recovery, and, above all, non-negotiable safety. But what makes the Modern Face Institute the ideal choice for your training in facial surgery?

## The Modern Face Philosophy: A New Era in Facial Surgery

**Modern Face**, created by Dr. Robério Brandão, is more than a set of surgical techniques; it is a philosophy that redefines the practice of facial surgery. It is based on three fundamental pillars:

* **Non-Negotiable Safety:** Prioritizing patient safety at every stage of the procedure.
* **Elegance in Simplicity:** seeking natural and harmonious results with minimally invasive techniques.
* **Optimized Recovery:** Minimizing recovery time, allowing patients to resume their activities as quickly as possible.

This philosophy translates into innovative techniques, such as **Endomidface by Direct Vision**, which revolutionized how surgeons approach the midface.

### Endomidface by Direct Vision: Precision and Safety without Endoscope

The **Endomidface by Direct Vision** technique, developed by Dr. Robério Brandão, is a milestone in minimally invasive facial surgery. By eliminating the need for an endoscope, this approach offers a series of advantages:

* **Greater Precision:** Direct vision allows the surgeon to have more precise control over the procedure, ensuring more natural and harmonious results.
* **Greater Safety:** By avoiding the use of complex equipment, the technique reduces the risk of complications and increases patient safety.
* **Accelerated Recovery:** The lower invasiveness of the technique results in a shorter recovery time, allowing patients to resume their activities in a few days.

The [Endomidface](/en/blog/endomidface-complete-guide) by Direct Vision technique, with its 212 documented cases and 0% permanent nerve injury, is the flagship of the Modern Face Institute, and the basis for training elite surgeons.

## Detailed Post-Operative Care

Procedure success depends as much on surgical technique as on post-operative care.

### First Days: Critical Phase

In this phase, small cares make big difference:

- **Elevated rest**: keep head elevated at 30-45° even when sleeping
- **Cold compresses**: apply in first 48h to reduce edema
- **Rigorous medication**: follow exactly prescribed schedules
- **Light diet**: prefer soft foods and avoid excessive chewing
- **Abundant hydration**: water helps in tissue recovery

### First Week: Intermediate Care

As healing advances:

- **Careful hygiene**: clean area as directed, without rubbing
- **Avoid sun exposure**: use hat and sunscreen when necessary to go out
- **Gentle facial movements**: avoid exaggerated expressions
- **Adequate sleep**: body recovers mainly during sleep
- **Avoid alcohol and tobacco**: both harm healing

### Weeks 2-4: Gradual Return

Return to activities should be progressive:

- **Light activities**: short walks are allowed
- **Remote work**: can be resumed as per comfort
- **Light makeup**: generally allowed after 2 weeks
- **Moderate exercises**: only with medical clearance
- **Lymphatic drainage**: indicated to accelerate recovery

### What to Avoid

During entire recovery period:

- Direct sun exposure on operated areas
- Intense physical activities before clearance
- Alcohol consumption in first 2 weeks
- Smoking (ideally stop 4 weeks before and after)
- Non-prescribed anti-inflammatories
- Sudden movements with face

## What to Expect: Recovery Timeline

Recovery is a journey requiring patience and specific care in each phase. Knowing what to expect helps reduce anxiety and optimize results.

### First 24-48 Hours

This is the most delicate period. It is normal to present:

- **Moderate to intense edema**: swelling is maximum in this period
- **Ecchymosis**: purple spots may appear and are natural part of healing
- **Controllable discomfort**: pain is generally mild to moderate, controlled with prescribed painkillers
- **Need for absolute rest**: avoid sudden movements and keep head elevated

### First Week (Days 3-7)

From third day, you will start noticing progressive improvements:

- Edema begins to decrease gradually
- Ecchymosis change color (purple → green → yellow)
- Stitches and dressings may be removed as per medical guidance
- Light activities can be resumed with caution

### Weeks 2-4

Important transition phase:

- Gradual return to social and professional activities
- Residual edema still present, but less noticeable
- Result begins to define, although not yet definitive
- Lymphatic drainage massages may be indicated

### Months 1-3

Final result consolidates progressively:

- Tissues settle into their definitive position
- Scars mature and become less visible
- Sensitivity returns gradually to normal
- Final result visible between 3-6 months

> "Patience is fundamental. Final result of a facial procedure can only be evaluated after 6 months, when all tissues have stabilized." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## Essential Questions in Consultation

A well-utilized consultation is fundamental for procedure success. Prepare yourself with right questions.

### About Surgeon's Experience

1. **"How many procedures similar to my case have you performed?"** — Case volume is experience indicator
2. **"Can I see before and after photos of patients with characteristics similar to mine?"** — Real results are best reference
3. **"What is your specific training in facial surgery?"** — Specialization makes difference in results

### About Proposed Technique

4. **"Why do you recommend this specific technique for my case?"** — Understand clinical reasoning
5. **"What are the alternatives and why is this best option?"** — Compare approaches
6. **"Where will scars be and how do they evolve over time?"** — Realistic expectations

### About Risks and Recovery

7. **"What are most common risks and how are they managed?"** — Transparency is essential
8. **"How long will I be away from normal activities?"** — Adequate planning
9. **"What type of anesthesia will be used?"** — Anesthetic safety
10. **"What is post-operative follow-up protocol?"** — Continuous support

### Signs of Good Surgeon

- Answers your doubts clearly and patiently
- Shows real results from previous cases
- Discusses risks transparently
- Does not promise unrealistic results
- Has adequate team and structure

## Post-Operative Warning Signs

Knowing warning signs allows early identification of any complication and quick action.

### When to Seek Surgeon Immediately

Some signs require urgent medical evaluation:

- **Active bleeding** that does not cease with light compression for 10-15 minutes
- **Fever** above 38°C, especially if accompanied by chills
- **Intense and sudden pain** not controlled with prescribed medication
- **Abrupt asymmetry** — much larger swelling on one side may indicate hematoma
- **Skin color change** — paleness or darkening in specific areas
- **Purulent discharge** with unpleasant odor

### Normal Signs (Do Not Worry)

These symptoms are expected and do not require concern:

- **Moderate edema** in first days, especially in morning
- **Ecchymosis** (purple spots) that change color progressively
- **Temporary tingling or numbness** in operated area
- **Pulling sensation** as tissues heal
- **Small temporary asymmetries** due to irregular edema
- **Difficulty smiling** or moving face in first days

### Safety Protocol

In case of doubt, follow this protocol:

1. **Document** — take photos and note symptoms
2. **Contact** — call surgeon's team
3. **Do not self-medicate** — avoid non-prescribed medications
4. **Keep calm** — most complications are manageable

> "In Modern Face, each patient receives a direct communication channel for emergencies. Safety is not luxury, is priority." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## Relevant Anatomy for This Procedure

Anatomical knowledge is fundamental to understand how results are achieved safely and effectively.

### Key Structures

The face is composed of layers that must be understood together:

- **Skin**: most superficial layer, reflecting aging through wrinkles and sagging
- **Subcutaneous tissue**: contains fat that redistributes with age
- **SMAS (Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System)**: fundamental layer connecting muscles to skin
- **Facial muscles**: responsible for expression and dynamic support
- **Retaining ligaments**: anchor skin to facial skeleton
- **Facial nerves**: control movement and sensitivity

### Surgical Planes

In Modern Face philosophy, we work in specific planes:

- **Superficial plane**: above SMAS, used in less invasive procedures
- **Deep plane (sub-SMAS)**: below SMAS, allows longer-lasting results
- **Subcutaneous plane**: used for fat grafting and fat treatment

### Why This Matters

Understanding anatomy explains:

- Why certain procedures last longer than others
- How natural results are achieved
- Why surgeon experience is crucial
- How complications can be avoided

> "Respect for anatomy is what separates natural result from artificial result. In Modern Face, each structure has its role and must be preserved or repositioned with precision." — Dr. Robério Brandão
