faq:
  - question: "Is it better to do blepharoplasty with facelift?"
    answer: "Frequently yes. The combination treats aging comprehensively and harmonizes results. It also saves one recovery. But each case is individual — some patients benefit from staged approaches."
  - question: "What's the sequence: blepharoplasty first or facelift?"
    answer: "If there's a browlift, it's done first (defines how much eyelid skin is truly excess). Then upper blepharoplasty, lower, and then facelift. The sequence avoids excessive skin removal."
  - question: "Doesn't isolated blepharoplasty resolve excess skin?"
    answer: "It depends. If the 'excess' skin is actually a fallen eyebrow over the eyelid, isolated blepharoplasty won't solve it — and can worsen (pull eyebrow down further). Careful evaluation is essential."
  - question: "What is canthopexy and when is it indicated?"
    answer: "Canthopexy is the fixation/elevation of the lateral eye corner. Indicated in lower blepharoplasty when there's eyelid laxity or ectropion risk. Prevents complications and improves eye shape."
  - question: "Is recovery much longer when combining procedures?"
    answer: "Not proportionally. Combining adds a few days to recovery, but doesn't double the time. Combined recovery of 2-3 weeks is more efficient than two separate 1-2 week recoveries each."
  - question: "What are the risks of combining blepharoplasty and facelift?"
    answer: "Additional risks are minimal in healthy patients. Longer surgical time is the main consideration. In elderly or comorbid patients, procedures can be separated for safety."
  - question: "Do I need blepharoplasty if I'm having a facelift?"
    answer: "Not necessarily. If eyelid skin excess is just ptotic eyebrow, browlift may resolve it. If there's true eyelid excess (true dermatochalasis), blepharoplasty adds benefit. Evaluation determines."

## The Eyes-Face Integration
The eyes are the focus of the face. When thinking about facial rejuvenation, we cannot
ignore the periorbital region. Blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery) and facelift are
frequently complementary — treating one without considering the other can create
disharmony.

## Types of Blepharoplasty
### Upper Blepharoplasty
Removes excess skin from upper eyelid (dermatochalasis). May include removal of
herniated fat.
**Attention:** Evaluate for eyebrow ptosis component before indicating.
### Lower Blepharoplasty
Treats bags and excess skin on lower eyelid. Transcutaneous or transconjunctival
approach.
**Attention:** Evaluate eyelid laxity — canthopexy may be necessary.

## The Critical Connection: Eyebrow-Eyelid
A common mistake: indicating upper blepharoplasty when the real problem is eyebrow
ptosis.
#### ⚠️ The Important Test
Manually elevate the patient's eyebrow to youthful position. If the eyelid skin
"excess" disappears, the problem is the eyebrow, not the eyelid.
**Solution:** Browlift (with or without limited blepharoplasty), not aggressive
isolated blepharoplasty.
Performing aggressive blepharoplasty when there's eyebrow ptosis can:
- 
✗
Pull the eyebrow further down
- 
✗
Create "surprised" appearance if browlift is later performed
- 
✗
Impair eye closure (lagophthalmos)

## Advantages of Combined Approach
#### Harmonious Result
Eyes and face rejuvenated in integrated manner, without disproportion.
#### Single Recovery
One 2-3 week recovery instead of two separate recoveries.
#### Cost-Benefit
Surgical center, anesthesia and team in single time — significant savings.
#### Precise Planning
By doing browlift first (if indicated), you know exactly how much eyelid skin to
remove.

## Recommended Surgical Sequence
1
#### Browlift (if indicated)
Defines final eyebrow position, clarifies how much skin is truly eyelid excess.
2
#### Upper Blepharoplasty
Removes excess skin and fat as needed, after defining eyebrow.
3
#### Lower Blepharoplasty + Canthopexy
Treats bags, excess skin. Canthopexy prevents ectropion and improves eye shape.
4
#### Endomidface / Facelift
Completes facial rejuvenation after defining periorbital region.
