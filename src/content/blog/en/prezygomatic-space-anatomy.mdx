faq:
  - question: "What is the prezygomatic space?"
    answer: "It's a virtual anatomical space located anterior to the zygomatic arch, between the SMAS and the zygomatic bone periosteum. It's an important dissection zone in midface lifting."
  - question: "Why is the prezygomatic space important in facial surgery?"
    answer: "This space allows safe access to midface structures, including malar fat and retaining ligaments, being fundamental for techniques like Endomidface."
  - question: "What structures limit the prezygomatic space?"
    answer: "Superiorly by the zygomatic arch, inferiorly by deep malar fat, medially by the zygomatic-cutaneous ligament, and laterally by the temporal extension of the SMAS."
  - question: "What's the relationship of the prezygomatic space with the facial nerve?"
    answer: "The zygomatic branches of the facial nerve pass superficially to the prezygomatic space. Correct dissection in this plane keeps the nerves protected above the surgical plane."

## Anatomical Definition
The **prezygomatic space** (prezygomatic space) is a virtual space that becomes
real during surgical dissection. It is located anterior to the zygomatic arch and represents
a transition zone between superficial and deep midface structures.
### Anatomical Boundaries
- **Superior:** Zygomatic arch and temporal fascia
- **Inferior:** Deep malar fat (SOOF)
- **Medial:** Zygomatic-cutaneous ligament
- **Lateral:** Temporal extension of SMAS
- **Anterior:** Orbicularis muscle and pre-orbicular fat
- **Posterior:** Zygomatic bone periosteum
## Surgical Importance
This space is fundamental in midface rejuvenation techniques because it allows access to
structures that need to be mobilized without compromising nerve structures.
### Dissection Advantages
- • Relatively avascular plane
- • Nerves remain superficial to the plane
- • Access to deep malar fat
- • Allows ligamentous release
### Necessary Precautions
- • Clearly identify boundaries
- • Don't deepen excessively
- • Respect zygomatic ligament
- • Careful hemostasis
## Relationship with Noble Structures
### Facial Nerve
The zygomatic and buccal branches of the facial nerve pass superficially** to the prezygomatic space, within or just below the SMAS. Correct dissection in the sub-SMAS
plane keeps these nerves protected.
Tip: Direct vision allows identifying nerves before any risk of injury.
### Facial Vessels
The facial artery and vein pass medially to the prezygomatic space. Perforating branches
may be encountered and should be carefully coagulated during dissection.
## Application in Endomidface
In Direct Vision Endomidface, the prezygomatic space is accessed through the temporal
incision. Dissection progresses from lateral to medial, allowing:
### 1. SOOF Access
Suborbicularis fat (SOOF) can be mobilized vertically.
### 2. Ligamentous Release
Zygomatic-cutaneous ligament can be released under vision.
### 3. Malar Repositioning
Descended malar tissue is elevated with vertical vector.
