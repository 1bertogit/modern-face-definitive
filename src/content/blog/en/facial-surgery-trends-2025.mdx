## The Current Scenario
Facial surgery is undergoing a transformation. The "skin stretching" paradigm has given
way to the concept of **deep structure repositioning**. Patients seek natural
results, quick recovery, and less invasive techniques with lasting results.
## Main Trends
### 1. Simplified Deep Plane Techniques
Approaches like Direct Vision Endomidface democratize access to deep techniques
without expensive equipment needs.
### 2. "Injected Face" Approach
With 90% of patients having biostimulator history, techniques that navigate fibrosis
become essential.
### 3. Vertical Vector
Progressive abandonment of lateral vectors that create "pulled" appearance in favor of
natural vertical elevation.
### 4. Accelerated Recovery
Less traumatic techniques allow return to activities in 7-10 days vs. 3-4 weeks of
traditional techniques.
### 5. Strategic Combination
Endomidface + Deep Neck + Browlift in a single time for complete facial rejuvenation.
## The Modern Face Philosophy
> "Modern Face is not just a technique — it's the recognition that contemporary faces are
> different from faces of 30 years ago. We need approaches that respect this reality."
