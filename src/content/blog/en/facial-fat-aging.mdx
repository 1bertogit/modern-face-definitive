faq:
  - question: "Does facial fat decrease with age?"
    answer: "Yes and no. Some compartments atrophy (lose volume), like temporal and deep malar fat. Others appear to increase because they descend (ptosis), like nasolabial fat. It's a combination of deflation and redistribution."
  - question: "What are facial fat compartments?"
    answer: "Facial fat isn't a single mass — it's divided into compartments separated by fibrous septa. Each compartment ages differently (atrophy, ptosis or herniation), creating characteristic aging patterns."
  - question: "Why does the nasolabial fold deepen?"
    answer: "Mainly from malar fat ptosis. The fat that was over the zygoma descends and accumulates over the fold, deepening it. It's not just volume loss — it's redistribution by gravity and loss of ligamentous support."
  - question: "Does filler resolve fat loss?"
    answer: "Partially. Filler can replace lost volume, but doesn't correct ptosis. If fat descended (didn't disappear), adding more volume can create a 'swollen' appearance. The ideal often combines repositioning (lifting) with selective volume."
  - question: "What is the buccal fat ball?"
    answer: "It's a deep fat pad in the cheek, between masseter and buccinator. Historically removed to thin the face, today bichectomy is controversial as it may accelerate aged appearance. Bichat's fat can contribute to jowl when it descends."
  - question: "Why do temples hollow with age?"
    answer: "Superficial temporal fat atrophies significantly with aging. Combined with temporal muscle atrophy, it creates characteristic 'sunken' temples. Filling this area can significantly rejuvenate."

## Beyond "Volume Loss"
It's common to hear that facial aging is caused by "volume loss." This is partially
true, but dramatically simplified. The reality is more complex — and understanding it
makes the difference between effective treatment and artificial results.
Facial fat is organized into **distinct compartments**, separated by
fibrous septa. Each compartment ages differently: some atrophy (lose volume), others
descend by gravity (ptosis), and some herniate through weakened structures.

## The Main Compartments
### **Location:** 
**With aging:** 


## Deflation vs Ptosis: Crucial Distinction
### Deflation (Atrophy)
Fat actually decreases in volume. The compartment "empties".
- • Hollow temples
- • Tear troughs from SOOF loss
- • Flattened cheekbones
Treatment: Volume replacement
### Ptosis (Descent)
Fat didn't disappear — it descended to a lower position.
- • Deep nasolabial fold
- • Jowl
- • Marionette lines
Treatment: Repositioning (lifting)
#### ⚠️ Common Error
Treating ptosis with filler. If malar fat descended (creating deep nasolabial fold),
adding more volume doesn't solve it — just creates a "swollen" face that still looks
aged. The correct approach is to reposition (elevate) the ptosed fat.

## Treatment Implications
#### Endomidface
Repositions ptosed malar fat back to youthful position over the zygoma. Corrects the
cause of nasolabial fold, not just camouflages it.
#### Selective Filling
Ideal for compartments that truly atrophied: temples, medial periorbital region,
lips. Small volumes, precisely positioned.
#### Combined Approach
Often the ideal: lifting to reposition ptosis + selective filling to replace volume
in areas of true atrophy.
