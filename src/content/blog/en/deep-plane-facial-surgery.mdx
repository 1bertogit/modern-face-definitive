faq:
  - question: "What does 'deep plane' mean in facial surgery?"
    answer: "Deep plane refers to dissection below the SMAS (Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System), accessing deeper facial structures for more durable and natural results."
  - question: "What is the advantage of working in deep plane?"
    answer: "By mobilizing deep structures together with skin and SMAS, excessive tension on skin is avoided, resulting in better scars, more natural results and greater longevity."
  - question: "Is deep plane more risky?"
    answer: "Historically yes, as it approaches noble structures. However, modern techniques like Direct Vision Endomidface allow deep plane work with increased safety."
  - question: "What is the difference between sub-SMAS and deep plane?"
    answer: "Sub-SMAS is any dissection below SMAS. Deep Plane specifically enters the plane between muscles and elevates the SMAS-skin complex as a unit."

## The Concept of Surgical Planes
The face is organized in layers, like an onion. Each "plane" represents a different
dissection depth, with distinct implications for result and safety.
### Subcutaneous Plane (Superficial)
Dissection only below skin. Oldest technique, short-lasting results, tension on skin.
### Supra-SMAS Plane
Dissection above SMAS with plication or SMASectomy. Improvement over subcutaneous, but
still limited.
### Sub-SMAS Plane (Deep)
Dissection below SMAS. Allows mobilization of deep structures. **Base of modern techniques of excellence.**
### Subperiosteal Plane
Dissection close to bone. Used in specific cases, greater morbidity.
## Why Is Deep Plane Superior?
### Advantages
- • **Lasting result** — structures support traction
- • **Naturalness** — mobilizes facial unit
- • **Less tension on skin** — better scar
- • **Possible vertical vector** — corrects real ptosis
- • **Complete rejuvenation** — not just skin
### Historical Challenges
- • Proximity to facial nerve
- • Steep learning curve
- • Longer surgical time
- • Risk in fibrous faces
- • Equipment dependency (some techniques)

## Evolution: From Deep Plane to Endomidface
Traditional Deep Plane demonstrated the value of deep plane. Direct Vision Endomidface
represents its evolution, maintaining benefits and reducing risks.
