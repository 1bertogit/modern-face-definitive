## What is Fat Grafting?
**Fat grafting** (lipofilling or lipoinjection) is the transfer of fat from one
body area (abdomen, flanks) to the face. Fat is processed and reinjected to restore volume lost
with aging.
## When to Combine with Facelift?
- • **Very deflated faces** — significant volume loss
- • **Hollow temples**
- • **Very deep grooves** that facelift won't completely correct
- • **Very flat midface**
## Advantages and Limitations
Your own fat causes no rejection and may have regenerative effects (stem cells). However,
resorption rate is variable (30-70%), possibly requiring touch-ups.
