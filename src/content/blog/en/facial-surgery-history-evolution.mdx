## A Continuous Evolution
The history of facial surgery is a story of progressive refinement. From procedures that
only removed skin to techniques that reposition deep structures, each generation of
surgeons built upon previous knowledge.
Understanding this evolution is not just historical curiosity — it helps understand **why** we do what we do today and **where** the specialty is heading.

## Timeline
### }

## Discoveries that Changed Everything
### The Discovery of SMAS (1976)
Mitz and Peyronie identified the Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System — a
continuous layer connecting facial expression muscles. They realized that tensioning
only the skin was insufficient; the SMAS needed to be manipulated for lasting
results.
### The Deep Plane Concept (1990)
Sam Hamra introduced the Deep Plane Facelift, dissecting *under* the SMAS instead
of over it. This allowed mobilization of tissues in a single block, with more natural
and lasting results — but required advanced anatomical knowledge.
### Fat Compartments (2000s)
Understanding that facial fat is organized in discrete compartments revolutionized
understanding of aging. It wasn't just "volume loss" — it was differentiated
deflation and ptosis of each compartment.

## The Modern Era: New Challenges
The 21st century brought an unexpected challenge: the **popularization of biostimulators**. Sculptra, Radiesse, Ellansé, and other products changed the anatomy of faces surgeons
encounter.
Techniques developed for "virgin" faces from treatments didn't work the same way on
faces with biostimulator-induced fibrosis. Anatomical planes were altered, dissection
was more difficult, risks were different.

## The Emergence of Modern Face
The Modern Face philosophy doesn't reject accumulated knowledge — it adapts it. It
recognizes that ~90% of today's patients have already received some type of injectable
treatment, and offers techniques designed for this reality:
- 
**Direct Vision Endomidface:** Subperiosteal dissection avoiding biostimulator-fibrosed
planes
- 
**Deep Neck without gland removal:** Cervical approach preserving functional
structures
- 
**No endoscope dependence:** Accessible techniques without expensive equipment

## The Future of Facial Surgery
If history teaches anything, it's that the specialty will continue evolving. Current
trends suggest:
#### Less is More
Less invasive techniques with faster recovery.
#### Personalization
Approaches adapted to each patient's specific profile.
#### Integration
Smart combination of surgery and non-invasive procedures.
#### Naturalness
Focus on results that rejuvenate without "looking operated".
