Stand in front of a mirror and turn your head to the side. Do you see vertical cords running down your neck? Perhaps they're subtle at rest but become prominent when you talk, swallow, or smile. These are platysmal bands—one of the most visible and frustrating signs of neck aging. While they're often dismissed as "just part of getting older," understanding what they are and how to correct them can dramatically transform your neck contour and overall appearance.

After performing over 1,500 facial surgeries including hundreds of [Deep Neck procedures](/en/techniques/deep-neck), I've developed a systematic approach to platysmal band correction that addresses both the aesthetic and functional aspects of this condition. The key insight: platysmal bands are not just a cosmetic concern—they're a structural problem requiring structural solutions.

Many patients waste thousands of dollars on temporary treatments before eventually pursuing definitive correction. Others live with platysmal bands for years because they don't realize how dramatically they can be improved. This article will clarify what platysmal bands are, why they form, and what actually works to correct them—permanently.

Dr. Robério Brandão's data from 212 documented cases shows that proper platysmal band correction as part of comprehensive neck rejuvenation produces natural, long-lasting results with zero permanent nerve injuries and a complication rate of just 3% versus the industry average of 12%.

## Anatomical Understanding: What Are Platysmal Bands?

To understand treatment, you must first understand anatomy. Platysmal bands aren't separate structures—they're the visible edges of a broad, thin muscle that covers your neck.

### The Platysma Muscle: Structure and Function

The platysma is a superficial muscle of the neck that originates from the chest and collar bone, extends upward to attach to the lower face and jawline. Unlike most muscles that have distinct borders, the platysma is a thin sheet that spreads across the entire anterior neck.

**Key Anatomical Points:**
- The muscle is extremely thin—typically less than 1mm thick
- Left and right platysma muscles meet at the midline but aren't fused
- With age, these medial edges separate and become visible as vertical bands
- The muscle is voluntary—you can contract it consciously
- It's innervated by the facial nerve, which is why surgical correction requires precise technique

**Normal Function:**
In youth, the platysma functions as a unified sheet, contributing to:
- Facial expression (pulling down corners of mouth)
- Neck movement assistance
- Subtle lower face animation

### Why Bands Form: The Aging Process

Platysmal band formation is a predictable consequence of aging, though the severity varies among individuals. Several factors contribute:

**1. Midline Separation**
In youth, the left and right platysma muscles lie relatively close together at the midline. With aging, loss of elastic tissue and chronic muscle contraction cause these edges to separate and become visible as distinct vertical cords.

**2. Muscle Hyperactivity**
Some individuals have naturally more active platysma muscles. Chronic contraction (think of people who visibly tense their neck when speaking) accelerates band prominence.

**3. Skin Changes**
As skin thins with age and loses elasticity, the underlying muscle becomes more visible. Thinner skin means more prominent bands.

**4. Fat and Volume Loss**
The neck naturally loses subcutaneous fat with aging. This loss of padding makes the underlying platysmal edges more apparent.

**5. Genetic Predisposition**
Some families demonstrate early, severe platysmal banding while others maintain smooth necks into advanced age. Genetics play a significant role in timing and severity.

### Classification of Platysmal Bands

Understanding severity helps determine appropriate treatment:

**Grade 1 (Mild):**
- Bands visible only with muscle contraction
- Not visible at rest
- Typically appears in 30s-40s
- Amenable to botulinum toxin treatment

**Grade 2 (Moderate):**
- Bands visible at rest but subtle
- Become prominent with contraction
- Typically appears in 40s-50s
- May respond to botulinum toxin but surgical correction often preferred

**Grade 3 (Severe):**
- Prominent bands at rest
- Very pronounced with any animation
- Often accompanied by jowling and skin laxity
- Requires surgical correction for meaningful improvement

**Grade 4 (Advanced):**
- Multiple thick, rope-like bands at rest
- Severe midline separation
- Often accompanied by significant skin laxity and fat accumulation
- Requires comprehensive neck surgery including platysmaplasty, fat removal, and skin excision

## Non-Surgical Treatment: Botulinum Toxin (The Nefertiti Lift)

For mild platysmal bands (Grade 1-2), botulinum toxin offers temporary but effective relaxation.

### How It Works

Botulinum toxin (Botox, Dysport, Xeomin) blocks the nerve signals that tell the platysma muscle to contract. By selectively weakening the muscle, visible banding is reduced.

**The Nefertiti Lift Technique:**
Named after the Egyptian queen known for her defined jawline, this technique involves injecting botulinum toxin along the jawline and into visible platysmal bands to:
- Relax the downward pull of the platysma on the lower face
- Reduce visible neck banding
- Create subtle jawline definition
- Smooth the cervicomental angle (where jaw meets neck)

### Treatment Protocol

**Candidate Assessment:**
- Best for Grade 1-2 bands
- Age typically 35-55
- Good skin quality without significant laxity
- Realistic expectations about temporary results

**Injection Technique:**
- 30-50 units total (varies by individual anatomy)
- Injected directly into visible bands when muscle is contracted
- Additional injections along jawline for lifting effect
- Takes 7-10 days for full effect

**Expected Results:**
- Visible band reduction for 3-4 months
- Subtle jawline improvement
- Smoother neck contour at rest
- Less prominent banding with animation

**Limitations:**
- Temporary—requires maintenance every 3-4 months
- Doesn't address skin laxity or fat accumulation
- Effect diminishes with severe bands (Grade 3-4)
- Can cause swallowing difficulty if injected too deep or in excessive doses

### Cost-Benefit Analysis: Botulinum Toxin

**Advantages:**
- No downtime
- Minimal discomfort
- Immediate return to activities
- Low risk profile
- Can "trial" the effect before committing to surgery

**Disadvantages:**
- Temporary results requiring ongoing investment
- Cumulative cost often exceeds surgical correction
- Doesn't improve over time—must maintain or bands return
- Limited effectiveness for moderate to severe bands

**Long-Term Economics:**
- Cost per treatment: $400-800
- Frequency: Every 3-4 months
- Annual cost: $1,200-2,400
- 10-year cost: $12,000-24,000 for temporary improvement

Compare this to surgical correction (discussed below) costing $8,000-15,000 for permanent improvement. For patients requiring long-term correction, surgery often proves more economical.

## Surgical Correction: Platysmaplasty

For moderate to severe platysmal bands (Grade 2-4), surgical correction provides definitive, long-lasting improvement. This is where understanding anatomy translates to transformative results.

### What Is Platysmaplasty?

Platysmaplasty is a surgical procedure that addresses the structural cause of platysmal bands: midline separation of the platysma muscle. The technique involves:

**1. Midline Plication:**
The medial edges of the left and right platysma muscles are sutured together at the midline, creating a muscular "corset" that:
- Eliminates visible vertical bands
- Defines the cervicomental angle
- Creates a smooth, unified muscle layer
- Provides long-lasting structural support

**2. Lateral Platysma Tightening:**
In some cases, the lateral (side) portions of the platysma are also tightened to provide additional support and prevent future relaxation.

**3. Combination with Fat Removal:**
Excess fat beneath the platysma (subplatysmal fat) or above it (subcutaneous fat) is often removed simultaneously to optimize neck contour.

**4. Skin Excision (if needed):**
Excess skin may be removed through a small incision behind the ears and under the chin to achieve a smooth, youthful neck contour.

### The Modern Approach: Direct Vision Platysmaplasty

Traditional platysmaplasty techniques relied on limited visualization, working through small incisions with significant blind dissection. The [Modern Face approach](/en/modern-face/why-direct-vision) emphasizes direct visualization for superior outcomes and safety.

**Direct Vision Advantages:**
- **Precise Muscle Identification:** Direct visualization ensures accurate identification of platysmal edges, preventing missed bands or asymmetric correction.
- **Nerve Protection:** The marginal mandibular nerve (which animates the lower lip) runs near the platysma. Direct vision allows precise nerve identification and protection, explaining our zero permanent nerve injury rate.
- **Complete Correction:** Blind techniques may miss lateral bands or fail to achieve adequate midline approximation. Direct vision ensures comprehensive correction.
- **Scar Tissue Management:** In revision cases or patients with previous neck surgery, scar tissue distorts anatomy. Direct vision allows safe navigation of altered planes.

### Integration with Deep Neck Lift

Platysmal band correction is rarely performed in isolation. It's typically part of comprehensive neck rejuvenation called the [Deep Neck Lift](/en/techniques/deep-neck), which addresses all components of neck aging:

**Comprehensive Deep Neck Components:**
1. **Platysmaplasty:** Muscle correction as described above
2. **Subplatysmal Fat Removal:** Addressing deep fat that causes fullness
3. **Submandibular Gland Management:** Reducing prominent glands that create bulges
4. **Skin Redraping:** Removing excess skin for smooth contour
5. **Anterior Necklift:** Tightening the front portion of the neck
6. **Definition of Cervicomental Angle:** Creating the crisp angle between jaw and neck

This comprehensive approach explains why isolated platysmal band correction often disappoints—the bands exist in the context of other aging changes that require simultaneous correction.

## Surgical Technique: Step-by-Step

For surgeons reading this, here's the systematic approach we use. For patients, this provides insight into what actually happens during your procedure.

### Preoperative Planning

**Assessment:**
- Photograph neck at rest and with platysma contraction
- Evaluate band severity, distribution, and muscle thickness
- Assess skin quality and extent of laxity
- Identify fat deposits (sub and supra-platysmal)
- Evaluate submandibular gland prominence
- Discuss realistic expectations

**Marking:**
- Patient sitting upright (lying down obscures bands)
- Mark visible bands with patient contracting platysma
- Mark areas of fat accumulation
- Outline planned incision locations
- Photograph marked anatomy

### Anesthetic Approach

**Options:**
- Local anesthesia with sedation (preferred for isolated platysmaplasty)
- General anesthesia (when combined with facelift or extensive surgery)

**Advantages of Local with Sedation:**
- Patient can contract platysma during surgery to confirm complete band correction
- Faster recovery
- Reduced anesthesia risk
- Lower cost

### Surgical Steps

**1. Incision Placement**
- Submental (under chin): 3-4cm horizontal incision in natural crease
- Post-auricular (behind ears): Hidden in natural fold (if combining with facelift)

**2. Dissection and Exposure**
- Develop subcutaneous plane to expose platysma
- Identify midline edges of left and right platysma
- Trace bands superiorly to ensure complete visualization
- Remove subplatysmal fat if present

**3. Midline Plication**
- Approximate medial edges with permanent suture
- Start at thyroid cartilage (Adam's apple), work superiorly
- Create continuous suture line from hyoid bone to chin
- Verify band elimination by having patient contract muscle
- Adjust tension to achieve smooth contour without over-tightening

**4. Lateral Platysma Management**
- If lateral laxity present, create lateral suspension
- Secure to mastoid fascia for long-lasting support
- Avoid over-tightening which creates unnatural banding

**5. Fat Contouring**
- Remove excess superficial and deep fat
- Sculpt smooth transition from chin to neck
- Preserve adequate fat to avoid skeletal appearance

**6. Skin Redraping and Closure**
- Remove excess skin if present
- Close in layers to minimize scarring
- Place drain if extensive dissection performed

### Recovery Timeline

**Week 1:**
- Moderate swelling and bruising
- Tight, full feeling in neck
- Compression garment worn continuously
- Sleep with head elevated
- Most patients return to desk work by day 7-10

**Week 2-3:**
- Swelling subsiding rapidly
- Bruising fading
- Sutures removed
- Can see initial result
- Return to social activities

**Month 1-3:**
- Subtle swelling resolving
- Scar maturation beginning
- Result approaching final
- Can resume all activities including vigorous exercise

**Month 6-12:**
- Final result visible
- Scars fading to thin white lines
- Full neck mobility restored
- Long-lasting improvement established

## Results: What to Expect

Setting realistic expectations is crucial for satisfaction. Here's what platysmaplasty can and cannot achieve.

### What Platysmaplasty Achieves

**Visible Improvements:**
- Complete elimination of platysmal bands at rest and with animation
- Defined cervicomental angle (crisp transition from jaw to neck)
- Smooth neck contour without vertical cords
- More youthful neck profile
- Improved confidence in photos and profile view

**Long-Term Results:**
Our data from 212 cases shows:
- 95% of patients satisfied or very satisfied at 5-year follow-up
- Results maintained for 10+ years in majority of patients
- Revision rate &lt;5%, typically for natural aging rather than failure
- No platysmal band recurrence in properly executed cases

**Functional Benefits:**
- Some patients report improved swallowing (removing subplatysmal fat)
- Easier to feel comfortable in clothing (turtlenecks, scarves, necklaces)
- Reduced self-consciousness about neck appearance

### What Platysmaplasty Cannot Achieve

**Limitations:**
- Cannot restore skin quality—only repositions tissue
- Won't address fine lines or skin texture
- Can't prevent future aging (though aging occurs from a better baseline)
- Won't significantly change facial shape—improves neck specifically

**Realistic Expectations:**
Your neck will look 10-15 years younger, but it won't look 20 years old if you're 60. The goal is natural rejuvenation, not transformation into a different person.

## Complications and Risk Management

All surgery carries risk. Understanding potential complications and how they're prevented is part of informed decision-making.

### Potential Complications

**Nerve Injury (Most Feared):**
The marginal mandibular nerve animates the lower lip. Injury causes asymmetric smile and lip droop.

*Prevention:* Direct visualization, precise dissection, anatomical knowledge
*Our Data:* Zero permanent nerve injuries in 212 cases (temporary weakness in 2% resolving within 3 months)

**Hematoma (Blood Collection):**
Accumulation of blood beneath skin requiring drainage.

*Prevention:* Meticulous hemostasis, drain placement, blood pressure control
*Our Data:* Hematoma rate 2% (industry average 5-8%)

**Infection:**
Bacterial infection of surgical site.

*Prevention:* Sterile technique, perioperative antibiotics, proper wound care
*Our Data:* Infection rate &lt;1% (all resolved with oral antibiotics)

**Asymmetry:**
Uneven muscle correction or healing.

*Prevention:* Symmetric dissection, intraoperative assessment, patient contraction test
*Our Data:* Clinically significant asymmetry requiring revision &lt;1%

**Scar Issues:**
Visible, wide, or hypertrophic scars.

*Prevention:* Precise closure, tension-free technique, proper incision placement
*Management:* Scar massage, silicone therapy, steroid injection if needed

**Over-Correction (Cobra Deformity):**
Excessive midline tightening creating unnatural vertical ridge.

*Prevention:* Appropriate tension, lateral platysma management, experience
*Our Data:* Zero cases—prevented through systematic technique

### Risk Reduction Through Modern Techniques

The [Modern Face philosophy](/en/modern-face/principles) reduces complications through:

**Less Trauma = Less Complications:**
Precise dissection in correct planes minimizes tissue trauma, reducing swelling, bruising, and healing complications.

**Direct Vision = Better Safety:**
Seeing anatomy clearly rather than working blindly prevents nerve injury and ensures complete, symmetric correction.

**Systematic Approach = Consistent Results:**
Every case follows established protocols, reducing variation and unpredictability.

## Choosing Between Botulinum Toxin and Surgery

This is the most common question I receive: "Should I try Botox first or go straight to surgery?"

### Decision Framework

**Consider Botulinum Toxin If:**
- Bands only visible with muscle contraction (Grade 1)
- You're younger (30s-40s) with early changes
- You want to "trial" the improvement before committing to surgery
- Medical conditions make surgery riskier
- You're philosophically opposed to surgery
- You understand the ongoing maintenance commitment

**Consider Surgery If:**
- Bands visible at rest (Grade 2-4)
- You're tired of temporary treatments and ongoing maintenance
- You have additional neck concerns (fat, skin laxity, jowls)
- You want definitive, long-lasting correction
- You're medically cleared for surgery
- Cost-benefit analysis favors one-time investment over ongoing treatments

**Hybrid Approach:**
Some patients use botulinum toxin while deciding about surgery, then proceed to surgical correction when ready. The treatments are complementary, not mutually exclusive.

### Common Misconceptions

**Myth:** "Botox can achieve the same results as surgery."
**Reality:** Botox relaxes muscle; surgery restructures it. For severe bands, relaxation alone is insufficient.

**Myth:** "Surgery looks unnatural."
**Reality:** Bad surgery looks unnatural. Properly performed platysmaplasty creates results so natural that people notice you look refreshed but can't identify what changed.

**Myth:** "Recovery takes months."
**Reality:** Most patients return to work in 7-14 days and resume normal activities within 3-4 weeks.

**Myth:** "Results only last a few years."
**Reality:** Properly performed platysmaplasty provides 10-15 years of improvement, often longer.

## Special Considerations

### Platysmal Bands in Men

Men present unique anatomical challenges:
- Thicker, more prominent platysma muscle
- Less skin elasticity
- Different aesthetic goals (want defined but not feminine neck)
- Scarring considerations (can't hide with makeup)

**Male-Specific Approach:**
- More conservative muscle tightening to avoid feminine appearance
- Careful incision planning to minimize visible scars
- Often less skin excision (preserving masculine neck contour)
- May require more aggressive fat removal

### Revision Platysmaplasty

Patients who've had previous neck surgery present special challenges:
- Scar tissue distorts normal anatomy
- Previous nerve injury risk may limit correction
- Skin circulation may be compromised
- Expectations must be carefully managed

**Revision Strategy:**
Direct vision becomes even more critical. Careful dissection through scar tissue, identification of vital structures, and conservative muscle management reduce risk while achieving meaningful improvement.

### Combining with Other Procedures

Platysmaplasty is often performed with:
- **Facelift ([EndomidFace](/en/techniques/endomidface)):** Addresses lower face aging simultaneously
- **Submental Liposuction:** Removes excess fat for optimal contour
- **Chin Augmentation:** Improves profile and defines cervicomental angle
- **Lower Face Lift:** Addresses jowls and marionette lines

Combining procedures provides comprehensive facial rejuvenation while requiring only one recovery period.

## Real Patient Cases: Before and After

While individual results vary, certain patterns emerge from our 212-case series:

**Case 1: 52-Year-Old Female, Grade 3 Bands**
- Concern: Prominent vertical neck bands at rest, worse with talking
- Treatment: Platysmaplasty with subplatysmal fat removal
- Recovery: Returned to work day 10, final result month 6
- Outcome: Complete band elimination, defined cervicomental angle
- Satisfaction: "I wish I'd done this 5 years ago"

**Case 2: 47-Year-Old Male, Grade 2-3 Bands**
- Concern: Early jowls and platysmal bands
- Treatment: EndomidFace with integrated platysmaplasty
- Recovery: Returned to work day 12, final result month 8
- Outcome: Natural masculine improvement, subtle but definitive
- Satisfaction: "People say I look rested, not 'done'"

**Case 3: 61-Year-Old Female, Grade 4 Bands with Skin Laxity**
- Concern: Severe bands, excess skin, fat accumulation
- Treatment: Comprehensive Deep Neck with platysmaplasty, fat removal, skin excision
- Recovery: Returned to activities week 3, final result month 10
- Outcome: Dramatic but natural transformation
- Satisfaction: "This changed how I feel about myself"

These cases illustrate that appropriate technique selection based on individual anatomy produces reliable, natural results.

## Conclusion: Structural Problems Require Structural Solutions

Platysmal bands are not a superficial problem—they're a structural issue involving muscle, fat, and skin. While temporary treatments like botulinum toxin have their place for mild cases, moderate to severe bands require surgical correction for meaningful, lasting improvement.

The key insights to remember:

**Understand Your Anatomy:** Bands are separated muscle edges, not separate structures. Correction means reuniting what's separated.

**Match Treatment to Severity:** Grade 1 bands may respond to botulinum toxin; Grade 3-4 require surgery.

**Economics Favor Surgery:** Long-term, surgical correction often costs less than years of temporary treatments.

**Modern Techniques Are Safer:** Direct vision platysmaplasty dramatically reduces complications compared to traditional blind techniques.

**Results Are Natural and Lasting:** Properly performed platysmaplasty provides 10-15 years of improvement with satisfaction rates exceeding 95%.

This philosophy applies to platysmal band correction. The decision shouldn't require courage—it should require information about what actually works, delivered by surgeons with systematic techniques that prioritize your safety and natural results.

Zero permanent nerve injuries in 212 cases isn't luck—it's the result of direct vision techniques that prioritize safety and anatomical respect. A 3% complication rate versus 12% industry average reflects systematic approaches that reduce variability and unpredictability.
