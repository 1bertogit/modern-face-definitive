## Can I Get a Facelift Again?
**Yes.** Many patients get a second facelift 8-15 years after the first. The secondary
procedure is technically more challenging due to altered anatomy, but is perfectly possible
with an experienced surgeon.
## Challenges of Secondary Facelift
- • **Previous scar:** Needs to be excised or incorporated
- • **Altered anatomy:** Planes may be different
- • **Less available tissue:** Skin was already advanced before
- • **Modified vascularization:** Requires extra care
- • **Expectations:** Patient knows the process
## When to Consider Revision?
### Natural Aging
Years after first facelift, aging continues. Normal after 10-15 years.
### Unsatisfactory Result
When first facelift didn't meet expectations. Evaluate cause first.
### Asymmetry or Complication
Correction of problems from previous procedure.
### Experience Makes a Difference
Secondary facelift requires advanced knowledge of anatomy and technique.
