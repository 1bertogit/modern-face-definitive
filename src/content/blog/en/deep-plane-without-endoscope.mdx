faq:
  - question: "What is traditional Deep Plane and why seek alternatives?"
    answer: "Deep Plane is a facelift technique that works below the SMAS, releasing deep structures. The traditional version requires extensive dissection and can present risks in faces with biostimulators. The modern alternative (Direct Vision Endomidface) offers comparable results with greater safety."
  - question: "Is it possible to do deep plane facelift without endoscope?"
    answer: "Yes. Direct Vision Endomidface works in the sub-SMAS areolar plane (descent space) without need for endoscopic equipment. Direct vision through strategic access allows safe dissection with simultaneous tactile feedback."
  - question: "What is the difference between traditional Deep Plane and Endomidface?"
    answer: "Traditional Deep Plane enters facial musculature and requires more extensive dissection. Endomidface respects natural anatomical spaces, is less invasive, allows faster recovery and is safer in faces with previous biostimulators."
  - question: "Is Endomidface result comparable to Deep Plane?"
    answer: "Yes, for midface rejuvenation. Endomidface offers vertical correction of the malar, improvement of nasolabial fold and natural result, without the risks and recovery time of traditional Deep Plane."
  - question: "Why is traditional Deep Plane contraindicated in injected faces?"
    answer: "Faces treated with biostimulators develop tissue fibrosis. In traditional Deep Plane, this fibrosis makes dissection difficult and increases risk of nerve injury. Direct Vision Endomidface allows identifying and navigating around these areas safely."
  - question: "How long does it take to recover from Deep Plane vs Endomidface?"
    answer: "Traditional Deep Plane requires 21-30 days of social recovery. Direct Vision Endomidface allows return to social activities in 7-10 days, with significantly less edema."

The **Deep Plane** revolutionized facial surgery by demonstrating that lasting
results require work on deep structures, not just skin. However, its traditional version brings
important limitations for the contemporary clinical reality.
The search for an **alternative to traditional Deep Plane** is not about abandoning
deep plane principles — it's about evolving them. The **Direct Vision Endomidface** represents this evolution, maintaining efficacy and increasing safety.

## The Challenge of Traditional Deep Plane in the Biostimulator Era
Deep Plane was developed in an era where faces arrived at surgery "virgin" from
treatments. Today, it's estimated that 90% of patients seeking facelift have already used
some type of biostimulator or filler.
### ⚠️ Risks of Deep Plane in Injected Faces
- 
•
**Tissue fibrosis** — biostimulators create scar tissue that makes dissection
difficult
- 
•
**Altered planes** — the traditional plane may no longer exist
- 
•
**Risk of nerve injury** — nerves may be "trapped" in fibrosis
- 
•
**More bloody dissection** — fibrous tissue bleeds more
- 
•
**Prolonged recovery** — greater tissue trauma
It's not that Deep Plane is a bad technique — it continues to be excellent for
never-treated faces. The problem is that this patient population has become a minority.

## Endomidface: The Deep Plane by Direct Vision
Direct Vision Endomidface offers a different approach: working in the **natural descent space** (sub-SMAS areolar plane), not forcing entry into musculature.

## Why Does Direct Vision Solve the Problem?
The fundamental concept is simple: when you **see and feel**
simultaneously, your ability to identify and avoid structures at risk multiplies.
### 🔍 Fibrosis Identification
Under direct vision, areas of fibrosis from biostimulators are visually identifiable —
they have color, texture and consistency different from normal tissue.
### ✋ Tactile Feedback
The surgeon feels tissue resistance while seeing. This allows adjusting technique in
real time according to anatomical variations of each patient.
### 🧭 Adaptive Navigation
Instead of following a predetermined plane (which may not exist in injected face), the
surgeon navigates through spaces that effectively exist.
### ⚡ Immediate Response
Any important structure (nerve, vessel) is identified before being injured. There are
no "surprises" as can happen in blind dissection.

## Who Benefits from the Alternative to Deep Plane?
### ✓ Patients with previous biostimulators
Sculptra, Radiesse, Ellansé or any biostimulator
### ✓ Patients who want fast recovery
Active professionals who can't be away for weeks
### ✓ Patients with mild comorbidities
Less invasive procedure = less physiological stress
### ✓ Patients who prioritize naturalness
Vertical vector preserves natural anatomy, without "stretched" appearance
