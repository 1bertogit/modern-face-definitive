## What Causes the Nasolabial Fold?
The nasolabial fold (popularly called "marionette lines") is formed by **descending malar fat**. With aging, the fat that should be on the cheekbone descends, creating excess volume
that "pushes" against the fixed line of the muscle running from nose to mouth corner.
> "The nasolabial fold is not a wrinkle — it's the result of midface ptosis. Filling the
> fold treats the symptom, not the cause."

> - — Dr. Robério Brandão
## Available Treatments
### Hyaluronic Acid Filler
Temporary improvement (6-12 months). Doesn't correct cause. Can create "duck lips" if
excessive.
### Biostimulators
Improves texture, but also doesn't correct ptosis. Creates fibrosis that can
complicate future surgery.
### Endomidface
**Treats the cause:** repositions descended malar fat. Lasting and natural
result.
