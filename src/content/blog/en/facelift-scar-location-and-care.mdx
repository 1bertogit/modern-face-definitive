# Facelift Scar: Location, Techniques, and Essential Care

The facelift scar is one of the biggest concerns for those considering the procedure. After all, the goal is to rejuvenate the face, not add visible marks. This article details the strategic location of the scar in a facelift, advanced techniques to minimize it, and crucial care for a discreet recovery, allowing you to feel confident and rejuvenated.

Dr. Robério Brandão, creator of the Modern Face philosophy and Direct Vision Endomidface techniques, emphasizes that the pursuit of natural and discreet results is one of the pillars of his approach. With over 18 years of facial surgery experience, Dr. Robério has developed techniques that minimize scar visibility, ensuring patients benefit from complete facial rejuvenation without compromising their natural appearance.

## Strategic Scar Location: Where Is It?

The location of the facelift scar is carefully planned to ensure maximum discretion. The technique used by Dr. Robério Brandão, following Modern Face principles, positions the scar in naturally hidden areas around the ear.

### Around the Ear: Natural Camouflage

The traditional facelift incision follows the ear contour, extending:
- **In front of the ear:** following the hairline in the temporal region and the anterior border of the ear.
- **Behind the ear:** following the retroauricular groove and the hairline on the nape.

This location allows the scar to camouflage into the natural lines of the face and scalp, making it less noticeable.

### Incision Variations: Adapting to Technique and Anatomy

Although the basic location is around the ear, the exact length and design of the incision may vary depending on:
- **Facelift extent:** a mini-lift may require smaller incisions, while a full facelift may need a longer incision.
- **Surgical technique:** different approaches, such as [Direct Vision Endomidface](/en/blog/endomidface-complete-guide), may allow for smaller and more localized incisions.
- **Patient anatomy:** hairline, ear shape, and amount of skin to be removed influence incision planning.

### The Temporal Incision: The Mark of Modern Face

In the Modern Face philosophy, the temporal incision is highlighted. The [Direct Vision Endomidface](/en/blog/endomidface-complete-guide) technique, developed by Dr. Robério Brandão, uses a smaller and more strategic incision, located entirely within the scalp in the temporal region.

This minimally invasive approach offers several advantages:
- **Discreet scar:** the incision is practically invisible because it is hidden within the hair.
- **Fast recovery:** a smaller incision contributes to a more comfortable post-operative period with less swelling.
- **Natural results:** the technique allows precise repositioning of facial tissues, providing naturally rejuvenated appearance.

## Techniques to Minimize Scarring: How to Achieve Discretion?

Surgeon skill and techniques used play a fundamental role in healing quality. Dr. Robério Brandão employs advanced techniques to minimize the appearance of the facelift scar, ensuring superior aesthetic results.

### Precise Incisions: The Art of Minimally Invasive Surgery

Precision in the incision is the first step to a discreet scar. Techniques such as the trichophytic incision, which preserves hair follicles at the incision edge, help ensure hair grows through the scar, naturally camouflaging it.

[Image: Illustration of trichophytic incision technique, showing how hair grows through the scar]

Additionally, using delicate instruments and minimally invasive techniques helps reduce tissue trauma, favoring smoother healing.

### Strategic Sutures: Joining Tissues with Precision

How tissues are joined also influences scar quality. Deep sutures, which support the skin, and superficial sutures, which align incision edges precisely, are essential for uniform healing.

[Image: Diagram showing different suture levels in a facelift]

Dr. Robério Brandão uses advanced suture techniques, such as intradermal suture, which hides stitches under the skin, minimizing scar visibility.

### The Correct Plane: Preserving Vascularization

Surgical technique is also crucial for preserving skin vascularization, ensuring it receives necessary nutrients for healthy healing. Careful tissue dissection and delicate handling of blood vessels help prevent skin necrosis and the formation of unsightly scars.

## Post-Operative Care: Your Role in Healing

Post-operative care is as important as surgical technique for ensuring optimized healing. Strictly following medical instructions is fundamental to minimizing scar appearance and obtaining the best possible results.

### Sun Protection: Healing's Number One Enemy

Sun exposure is the biggest villain in healing. UV radiation stimulates melanin production, the pigment that gives skin color, causing scar darkening.

[Infographic: Comparison of a sun-protected scar and a sun-exposed scar]

To protect the scar from the sun, it is essential to:
- **Use sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher:** apply generously to the scar area, reapplying every two hours or after swimming or sweating.
- **Avoid direct sun exposure:** use hats and long-sleeved clothing to protect the scar area, especially during peak UV radiation hours (between 10 am and 4 pm).
- **Use physical barriers:** micropore tape or silicone sheets can help protect the scar from the sun and reduce tension in the area.

### Healing Products: Your Allies in Recovery

There are several topical products that can aid in healing, such as creams and ointments based on:
- **Silicone:** helps hydrate skin, reduce inflammation, and prevent keloid and hypertrophic scar formation.
- **Rosehip:** has regenerative and antioxidant properties, aiding in healing and skin lightening.
- **Vitamin C:** stimulates collagen production, strengthens skin, and aids in healing.
- **Hyaluronic acid:** hydrates skin, fills fine lines and wrinkles, and aids in healing.

It is important to consult Dr. Robério Brandão to determine the most suitable products for your case and follow usage instructions.

### Massage and Lymphatic Drainage: Stimulating Circulation and Reducing Swelling

Gentle massage on the scar area and facial lymphatic drainage can help improve blood circulation, reduce swelling, and accelerate healing.

Massage should be performed with gentle circular movements, applying light pressure on the scar. Lymphatic drainage helps eliminate excess fluids and toxins, reducing swelling and promoting healing.

### Aesthetic Treatments: Optimizing Scar Appearance

In some cases, aesthetic treatments may be indicated to improve scar appearance, such as:
- **Laser:** helps smooth scar texture, reduce redness, and stimulate collagen production.
- **Microneedling:** stimulates collagen and elastin production, improving scar texture and appearance.
- **Corticoide injections:** can be used to treat keloids and hypertrophic scars, reducing volume and redness.

Dr. Robério Brandão can indicate the most suitable treatment for your case, taking into account scar type, skin color, and your expectations.

## Time and Patience: The Healing Process

Healing is a gradual and continuous process that takes time to complete. It is important to be patient and follow medical instructions to obtain the best possible results.

[Infographic: Healing timeline, showing different phases and estimated time for each]

### Healing Phases: Understand the Process

Healing goes through different phases:
- **Inflammatory phase:** lasts from a few days to a few weeks, characterized by redness, swelling, and sensitivity in the incision area.
- **Proliferative phase:** lasts from a few weeks to a few months, characterized by collagen and new blood vessel formation.
- **Remodeling phase:** can last from a few months to a year, characterized by collagen reorganization and gradual scar fading.

### How Long Does It Take for the Scar to Fade?

The time needed for the scar to fade varies from person to person, depending on factors such as:
- **Genetics:** some people are more predisposed to forming visible scars.
- **Skin type:** lighter skin tends to have less apparent scars than darker skin.
- **Post-operative care:** following medical instructions and protecting the scar from the sun are crucial for proper healing.

In general, the scar tends to fade gradually over several months, taking up to a year to reach its final appearance.

## Abnormal Scars: Keloids and Hypertrophic Scars

Although modern techniques and proper care minimize risk, some people may develop abnormal scars, such as keloids and hypertrophic scars.

### Keloids vs. Hypertrophic Scars: Understand the Difference

- **Keloids:** grow beyond original incision boundaries, invading surrounding healthy skin.
- **Hypertrophic scars:** remain within incision boundaries but are raised and thick.

[Comparison Table: Characteristics, causes, and treatments of keloids and hypertrophic scars]

### Treatments for Abnormal Scars: Recovering Aesthetics

There are several treatments available to improve the appearance of keloids and hypertrophic scars, such as:
- **Corticoide injections:** help reduce inflammation and scar volume.
- **Laser:** smooths scar texture and reduces redness.
- **Cryotherapy:** freezes the scar, destroying abnormal cells.
- **Radiotherapy:** used in more severe keloid cases to prevent scar growth.
- **Surgery:** can be used to remove keloid or hypertrophic scar, but there is recurrence risk.

Dr. Robério Brandão can indicate the most suitable treatment for your case, taking into account scar type, location, and your expectations.

## What to Expect: Recovery Timeline

Recovery is a journey requiring patience and specific care at each phase. Knowing what to expect helps reduce anxiety and optimize results.

### First 24-48 Hours

This is the most delicate period. It is normal to have:

- **Moderate to intense edema**: swelling is maximum in this period
- **Bruising**: purple spots may appear and are a natural part of healing
- **Controllable discomfort**: pain is generally mild to moderate, controlled with prescribed painkillers
- **Need for absolute rest**: avoid sudden movements and keep head elevated

### First Week (Days 3-7)

From the third day, you will start noticing progressive improvements:

- Edema begins to decrease gradually
- Bruising changes color (purple → green → yellow)
- Stitches and dressings may be removed as per medical advice
- Light activities can be resumed with caution

### Weeks 2-4

Important transition phase:

- Gradual return to social and professional activities
- Residual edema still present but less noticeable
- Result begins to define, although not yet definitive
- Lymphatic drainage massages may be indicated

### Months 1-3

Final result consolidates progressively:

- Tissues settle into their definitive position
- Scars mature and become less visible
- Sensitivity gradually returns to normal
- Final result visible between 3-6 months

> "Patience is fundamental. The final result of a facial procedure can only be evaluated after 6 months when all tissues have stabilized." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## Post-Operative Warning Signs

Knowing warning signs allows early identification of any complication and quick action.

### When to Seek Surgeon Immediately

Some signs require urgent medical evaluation:

- **Active bleeding** that does not stop with light compression for 10-15 minutes
- **Fever** above 38°C (100.4°F), especially if accompanied by chills
- **Intense and sudden pain** not controlled with prescribed medication
- **Abrupt asymmetry** — much larger swelling on one side may indicate hematoma
- **Skin color change** — paleness or darkening in specific areas
- **Purulent discharge** with unpleasant odor

### Normal Signs (Do Not Worry)

These symptoms are expected and do not require concern:

- **Moderate edema** in the first days, especially in the morning
- **Bruising** (purple spots) that change color progressively
- **Tingling or numbness** temporarily in the operated area
- **Pulling sensation** as tissues heal
- **Small temporary asymmetries** due to irregular edema
- **Difficulty smiling** or moving face in the first days

### Safety Protocol

In case of doubt, follow this protocol:

1. **Document** — take photos and note symptoms
2. **Contact** — call the surgeon's team
3. **Do not self-medicate** — avoid non-prescribed medications
4. **Stay calm** — most complications are manageable

> "In Modern Face, every patient receives a direct communication channel for emergencies. Safety is not a luxury, it is a priority." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## Detailed Post-Operative Care

Procedure success depends on both surgical technique and post-operative care.

### First Days: Critical Phase

In this phase, small precautions make a big difference:

- **Elevated rest**: keep head elevated at 30-45° even when sleeping
- **Cold compresses**: apply in the first 48h to reduce edema
- **Strict medication**: follow exactly prescribed schedules
- **Light diet**: prefer soft foods and avoid excessive chewing
- **Abundant hydration**: water helps with tissue recovery

### First Week: Intermediate Care

As healing advances:

- **Careful hygiene**: clean area as directed, without rubbing
- **Avoid sun exposure**: use hat and sunscreen when necessary to go out
- **Gentle facial movements**: avoid exaggerated expressions
- **Adequate sleep**: body recovers mainly during sleep
- **Avoid alcohol and tobacco**: both impair healing

### Weeks 2-4: Gradual Return

Return to activities should be progressive:

- **Light activities**: short walks are allowed
- **Remote work**: can be resumed as comfortable
- **Light makeup**: generally allowed after 2 weeks
- **Moderate exercise**: only with medical clearance
- **Lymphatic drainage**: indicated to accelerate recovery

### What to Avoid

Throughout the recovery period:

- Direct sun exposure on operated areas
- Intense physical activities before clearance
- Alcohol consumption in the first 2 weeks
- Smoking (ideally stop 4 weeks before and after)
- Non-prescribed anti-inflammatories
- Sudden movements with the face
