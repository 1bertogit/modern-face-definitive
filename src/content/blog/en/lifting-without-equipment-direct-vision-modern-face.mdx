## Relevant Anatomy for This Procedure

Anatomical knowledge is fundamental to understand how results are achieved safely and effectively.

### Key Structures

The face is composed of layers that must be understood together:

- **Skin**: most superficial layer, reflecting aging through wrinkles and sagging
- **Subcutaneous tissue**: contains fat that redistributes with age
- **SMAS (Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System)**: fundamental layer connecting muscles to skin
- **Facial muscles**: responsible for expression and dynamic support
- **Retaining ligaments**: anchor skin to facial skeleton
- **Facial nerves**: control movement and sensitivity

### Surgical Planes

In Modern Face philosophy, we work in specific planes:

- **Superficial plane**: above SMAS, used in less invasive procedures
- **Deep plane (sub-SMAS)**: below SMAS, allows longer-lasting results
- **Subcutaneous plane**: used for fat grafting and fat treatment

### Why This Matters

Understanding anatomy explains:

- Why certain procedures last longer than others
- How natural results are achieved
- Why surgeon experience is crucial
- How complications can be avoided

> "Respect for anatomy is what separates natural result from artificial result. In Modern Face, each structure has its role and must be preserved or repositioned with precision." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## Comparison: Techniques and Approaches

Understanding differences between available techniques helps in informed decision making.

### Overview of Approaches

| Aspect | Traditional Techniques | Modern Face |
|---------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Surgical plane** | Generally superficial | Deep (sub-SMAS) |
| **Traction vector** | Predominantly lateral | Vertically anatomically correct |
| **Incisions** | Extensive, multiple areas | Minimal, strategically positioned |
| **Recovery** | 2-4 weeks | 7-14 days on average |
| **Durability** | 5-7 years | 10-15 years |
| **Naturalness** | Risk of "stretched" look | Preserves natural expression |

### Advantages of Modern Approach

Modern Face technique offers specific benefits:

- **More natural results**: vertical vector respects facial anatomy
- **Shorter recovery time**: minimally invasive techniques accelerate healing
- **Superior durability**: work in deep plane offers longer-lasting support
- **Less visible scars**: strategic and smaller incisions
- **Preservation of expressiveness**: face remains natural and mobile

### When Each Technique is Indicated

Choice of technique depends on individual factors:

- **Degree of aging**: more advanced cases may require more comprehensive approaches
- **Areas of concern**: midface, lower face, or neck have specific techniques
- **Patient expectations**: balance between desired result and acceptable recovery
- **History of previous procedures**: revisions require special planning

## Detailed Post-Operative Care

Procedure success depends as much on surgical technique as on post-operative care.

### First Days: Critical Phase

In this phase, small cares make big difference:

- **Elevated rest**: keep head elevated at 30-45° even when sleeping
- **Cold compresses**: apply in first 48h to reduce edema
- **Rigorous medication**: follow exactly prescribed schedules
- **Light diet**: prefer soft foods and avoid excessive chewing
- **Abundant hydration**: water helps in tissue recovery

### First Week: Intermediate Care

As healing advances:

- **Careful hygiene**: clean area as directed, without rubbing
- **Avoid sun exposure**: use hat and sunscreen when necessary to go out
- **Gentle facial movements**: avoid exaggerated expressions
- **Adequate sleep**: body recovers mainly during sleep
- **Avoid alcohol and tobacco**: both harm healing

### Weeks 2-4: Gradual Return

Return to activities should be progressive:

- **Light activities**: short walks are allowed
- **Remote work**: can be resumed as per comfort
- **Light makeup**: generally allowed after 2 weeks
- **Moderate exercises**: only with medical clearance
- **Lymphatic drainage**: indicated to accelerate recovery

### What to Avoid

During entire recovery period:

- Direct sun exposure on operated areas
- Intense physical activities before clearance
- Alcohol consumption in first 2 weeks
- Smoking (ideally stop 4 weeks before and after)
- Non-prescribed anti-inflammatories
- Sudden movements with face

## Conclusion

Endomidface by Direct Vision technique represents a **revolution in facelift**, offering a **safe, effective, and accessible** approach. By eliminating need for expensive equipment and valuing surgeon's expertise and understanding of facial anatomy, Modern Face provides natural and long-lasting results, with shorter recovery time and lower risk of complications.
