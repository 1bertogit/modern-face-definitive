# Mini Facelift vs Full Facelift: Which is the Best Option to Rejuvenate the Face?

The search for a rejuvenated face leads many people to consider different facial surgery options. Among the available alternatives, the **mini facelift** and the **full facelift** (or rhytidectomy) stand out. But, after all, what is the difference between them? Which one is most suitable for each case? This article, prepared by Dr. Robério Brandão, a specialist in facial surgery and creator of the [Modern Face](/en/blog/modern-face-concept-philosophy) philosophy, aims to clarify these doubts, presenting a complete guide to assist in your decision.

## What is a Mini Facelift?

The mini facelift, also known as limited [facelift](/en/blog/facelift-complete-guide), is a surgical procedure **less invasive** than the full facelift. It aims to treat the **first signs of aging** in the face, such as mild sagging in the jaw region (jowls) and loss of facial contour definition.

### How is the Mini Facelift Performed?

The mini facelift technique generally involves:

*   **Smaller incisions:** Incisions are shorter and more discreet than those of a full facelift, usually located around the ear.
*   **Limited dissection:** The detachment of skin and underlying tissues is less extensive, focusing on problem areas.
*   **Tissue repositioning:** Tissues are repositioned and fixed to restore a more youthful facial contour.
*   **Shorter surgical time:** The surgery usually lasts less time than a full facelift.

### What are the Advantages of the Mini Facelift?

*   **Correction of mild aging signs:** Ideal for patients with early signs of aging.
*   **Smaller scars:** Reduced incisions result in more discreet and easier-to-hide scars.
*   **Faster recovery:** Recovery time is usually shorter than that of a full facelift, allowing a quicker return to daily activities.
*   **Less invasive:** Being less extensive, the mini facelift generally presents a lower risk of complications.
*   **Natural results:** When well indicated, the mini facelift can provide subtle and natural results, rejuvenating the face without drastically altering the patient's characteristics.

### What are the Disadvantages and Limitations?

*   **Less durable results:** The results of the mini facelift may not be as long-lasting as those of the full facelift, especially in patients with a higher degree of sagging.
*   **Limitations:** The mini facelift is not capable of treating all signs of facial aging, such as neck sagging or cheek drooping.
*   **Recommendation:** "The mini facelift is ideal for patients with early signs of aging who want a subtle improvement and a quick recovery," says Dr. Robério Brandão.

## What is a Full Facelift?

The full facelift, also known as rhytidectomy, is a surgical procedure more **comprehensive** than the mini facelift. It aims to treat **advanced signs of aging** in the face and neck, such as generalized sagging, volume loss, and deep wrinkles.

### How is the Full Facelift Performed?

The full facelift generally involves:

*   **More extensive incisions:** Incisions are larger than those of the mini facelift, usually located around the ear and into the hairline.
*   **Extensive dissection:** Skin and underlying tissues are detached over a larger area, allowing for more complete repositioning.
*   **Repair of deep structures:** In addition to skin repositioning, the full facelift may involve treatment of deep facial structures, such as muscles and fat.
*   **Excess skin reduction:** Excess skin is removed to create a more defined facial contour.
*   ** longer surgical time:** The surgery usually lasts longer than a mini facelift.

### What are the Advantages of the Full Facelift?

*   **Longer-lasting results:** The results of the full facelift tend to be longer-lasting than those of the mini facelift, providing more significant facial rejuvenation.
*   **Correction of multiple signs of aging:** The full facelift is capable of treating a wide range of aging signs, including neck sagging, cheek drooping, and deep wrinkles.
*   **Comprehensive rejuvenation:** The full facelift rejuvenates the entire face and neck, creating a younger and more harmonious appearance.

### What are the Disadvantages and Limitations?

*   **More extensive scars:** Larger incisions result in more visible scars, although they can usually be hidden in the hairline and around the ear.
*   **Longer recovery:** Recovery time is usually longer than that of the mini facelift, requiring a period of absence from daily activities.
*   **More invasive:** Being more extensive, the full facelift generally presents a higher risk of complications.
*   **Recommendation:** "The full facelift is indicated for patients with advanced signs of facial aging who want comprehensive and long-lasting rejuvenation," explains Dr. Robério Brandão.

## Modern Face Philosophy and the Right Choice

In the Modern Face philosophy, the choice between mini facelift and full facelift goes beyond simple technique comparison. It involves an individualized assessment of the patient, considering:

*   **Facial anatomy:** The unique characteristics of each patient's face.
*   **Goals:** What the patient hopes to achieve with the surgery.
*   **Expectations:** If the patient has realistic expectations about the results.
*   **Lifestyle:** If the patient can afford a longer recovery time.

### The Importance of Individualized Assessment

"There is no single technique that fits all patients," emphasizes Dr. Robério Brandão. "The choice of the most appropriate procedure must be made together with the surgeon, after a thorough assessment of the face and an honest discussion about the patient's goals and expectations."

### The Modern Face Vision

Modern Face values:

*   **Natural results:** Surgery should enhance individual beauty, without creating an artificial or "stretched" appearance.
*   **Facial harmony:** Rejuvenation must be balanced, respecting the proportions and characteristics of the face.
*   **Patient well-being:** Recovery should be as fast and comfortable as possible, allowing a quick return to daily activities.

## Complementary Techniques for Optimized Results

Regardless of the choice between mini facelift and full facelift, other techniques can be used to optimize results, such as:

*   **Fat Grafting:** Injection of the patient's own fat to restore lost volume in areas such as cheeks and temples.
*   **Hyaluronic Acid Filler:** Use of fillers to smooth wrinkles and furrows, and restore volume in specific areas.
*   **Botulinum Toxin (Botox):** Botox application to smooth expression wrinkles and prevent new wrinkles from forming.
*   **Laser and Peeling:** Use of laser and peeling to improve skin texture and reduce spots.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What is the ideal age for a facelift?

There is no ideal age, but rather an individualized indication. A facelift is recommended for patients showing signs of facial aging that cannot be corrected with other treatments.

### Does a facelift hurt?

During surgery, the patient feels no pain, as they are under anesthesia. In the post-operative period, it is common to feel some discomfort, which can be controlled with medication.

### How long do facelift results last?

Durability of results varies from person to person, but in general, a full facelift provides longer-lasting results than a mini facelift.

### What are the risks of a facelift?

Like any surgery, a facelift presents risks such as bleeding, infection, hematoma, and changes in skin sensation. However, these risks are minimized when the procedure is performed by an experienced and qualified plastic surgeon. Dr. Robério Brandão, with over 1,500 facial surgeries performed and 0% permanent nerve injury in 212 consecutive documented Endomidface cases, demonstrates the safety that experience and method can provide.

### Does a facelift leave very visible scars?

Facelift scars are generally discreet and can be hidden in the hairline and around the ear.

## What to Expect: Recovery Timeline

Recovery is a journey requiring patience and specific care in each phase. Knowing what to expect helps reduce anxiety and optimize results.

### First 24-48 Hours

This is the most delicate period. It is normal to present:

- **Moderate to intense edema**: swelling is maximum in this period
- **Ecchymosis**: purple spots may appear and are natural part of healing
- **Controllable discomfort**: pain is generally mild to moderate, controlled with prescribed painkillers
- **Need for absolute rest**: avoid sudden movements and keep head elevated

### First Week (Days 3-7)

From third day, you will start noticing progressive improvements:

- Edema begins to decrease gradually
- Ecchymosis change color (purple → green → yellow)
- Stitches and dressings may be removed as per medical guidance
- Light activities can be resumed with caution

### Weeks 2-4

Important transition phase:

- Gradual return to social and professional activities
- Residual edema still present, but less noticeable
- Result begins to define, although not yet definitive
- Lymphatic drainage massages may be indicated

### Months 1-3

Final result consolidates progressively:

- Tissues settle into their definitive position
- Scars mature and become less visible
- Sensitivity returns gradually to normal
- Final result visible between 3-6 months

> "Patience is fundamental. Final result of a facial procedure can only be evaluated after 6 months, when all tissues have stabilized." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## Post-Operative Warning Signs

Knowing warning signs allows early identification of any complication and quick action.

### When to Seek Surgeon Immediately

Some signs require urgent medical evaluation:

- **Active bleeding** that does not cease with light compression for 10-15 minutes
- **Fever** above 38°C, especially if accompanied by chills
- **Intense and sudden pain** not controlled with prescribed medication
- **Abrupt asymmetry** — much larger swelling on one side may indicate hematoma
- **Skin color change** — paleness or darkening in specific areas
- **Purulent discharge** with unpleasant odor

### Normal Signs (Do Not Worry)

These symptoms are expected and do not require concern:

- **Moderate edema** in first days, especially in morning
- **Ecchymosis** (purple spots) that change color progressively
- **Temporary tingling or numbness** in operated area
- **Pulling sensation** as tissues heal
- **Small temporary asymmetries** due to irregular edema
- **Difficulty smiling** or moving face in first days

### Safety Protocol

In case of doubt, follow this protocol:

1. **Document** — take photos and note symptoms
2. **Contact** — call surgeon's team
3. **Do not self-medicate** — avoid non-prescribed medications
4. **Keep calm** — most complications are manageable

> "In Modern Face, each patient receives a direct communication channel for emergencies. Safety is not luxury, is priority." — Dr. Robério Brandão
