faq:
  - question: "How to avoid the 'pulled' appearance in facelift?"
    answer: "The pulled appearance results from excessive lateral tension. Modern Face technique uses vertical vectors — lifting where gravity pulls down — instead of lateral tension. This restores natural positions without distortion."
  - question: "Does facelift leave artificial appearance?"
    answer: "It shouldn't. A well-executed facelift rejuvenates without altering facial features. Patient should look 'refreshed' and younger — not different. Modern techniques like Endomidface prioritize naturalness."
  - question: "What's the difference between vertical and lateral vector?"
    answer: "Lateral vector pulls tissues back and up, creating tension in temporal region — typical 'windswept' look. Vertical vector lifts tissues in direction opposite to gravity, restoring youthful natural position."
  - question: "Why do some people look strange after facelift?"
    answer: "Usually due to: excessive tension, inadequate vectors (too lateral), excess skin removal, or poorly calibrated additional procedures (eyes, lips). Proper technique and conservative planning prevent this."
  - question: "How to know if my surgeon will achieve natural result?"
    answer: "Ask to see previous cases — not just marketing photos. Observe if patients look natural or 'operated'. Clearly discuss your expectation. Experienced surgeons know when to be conservative."
  - question: "Does more subtle facelift last less?"
    answer: "Not necessarily. Natural results depend on technique, not 'amount' of lifting. Endomidface with vertical vectors creates lasting structural support while maintaining natural appearance. Duration depends more on technical quality than aggressiveness."

## The Universal Fear: "I Don't Want to Look Operated"
This is probably the number one concern of patients considering facial surgery: fear of
ending up with "windswept" look — that pulled, tense, artificial appearance we see in
some poorly operated celebrities.
And it's a legitimate concern. We all know examples of people who clearly "had something
done" — and not in a flattering way. Artificial appearance is real, happens, and is
avoidable.

The [Modern Face philosophy has as one of its pillars **Elegance in Results** — precisely to avoid this
unwanted outcome.

## Why Do Artificial Results Happen?
Before understanding how to avoid, we need to understand causes of unnatural results:
### 1. Wrong Vectors
Traction vector determines how tissues reposition. Excessively lateral vectors (back
and up) create "windswept" appearance — pulled eyes, tensed mouth, permanent
surprised expression.
### 2. Excessive Tension
More isn't better. Excessive tension on skin or SMAS creates tense, unnatural
appearance. Over time, this tension can lead to progressive distortions or
accelerated recurrence.
### 3. Excessive Skin Removal
"Stretching" skin without repositioning deep structures creates visible superficial
tension. Less skin removal with better SMAS repositioning generates more natural and
lasting result.
### 4. Poorly Calibrated Additional Procedures
Aggressive blepharoplasty, excessive brow lift, disproportionate lip filler —
procedures that individually could be adequate, together create artificial ensemble.

## The Solution: Vertical Vectors
The fundamental principle for natural results is simple: **lift where gravity pulls down**.
With aging, gravity pulls tissues downward. Malar descends, creating nasolabial fold.
Cheeks fall, creating jowl. Natural logic is to lift vertically — restore original
position.
### ❌ Lateral Vector (Windswept)
Direction: Back and up (↗)
Result: Pulled, tense, surprised
Problem: Against natural aging direction
Durability: May recur faster
### ✅ Vertical Vector (Modern Face)
Direction: Straight up (↑)
Result: Natural, rested, rejuvenated
Logic: Opposite to gravity, restores youthful position
Durability: Lasting structural support
The Endomidface technique was developed specifically with vertical vectors in mind. Fixation is done on
deep temporal fascia in vertical direction, restoring youthful malar position without lateral
tension.

## Principles for Natural Results
1
### Reposition, Don't Stretch
Goal is to restore tissues to youthful position, not create tension. Techniques
working on deep structures (SMAS, periosteum) allow repositioning with minimal
skin tension.
2
### Calculated Conservatism
Less is often more. Subtle result that can be complemented is preferable to
excessive result that can't be undone.
3
### Respect Individual Anatomy
Each face has unique proportions. Goal is to rejuvenate patient's face, not create
standardized face.
4
### Harmony Between Procedures
If combining facelift with blepharoplasty, rhinoplasty or others, each procedure
must be calibrated for harmonic joint result.
5
### Appropriate Patient Selection
Not every patient is surgery candidate. Unrealistic expectations, unfavorable
anatomy or inadequate timing are contraindications for natural results.
