# Blepharoplasty and Facelift: The Definitive Guide for Complete Rejuvenation

The search for effective facial rejuvenation often leads to the question: what is the best approach? The answer, most of the time, involves the strategic combination of procedures. **Blepharoplasty** and **facelift**, when performed together, offer remarkable and harmonious results.

In this article, Dr. Robério Brandão, creator of the Modern Face philosophy and specialist in facial rejuvenation techniques, explores the synergy between these two procedures. Discover how combining blepharoplasty with a facelift can transform your appearance, restoring vitality and youthfulness to your face.

## Understanding Blepharoplasty and Facelift

Before we dive into combining these procedures, it's crucial to understand what each offers individually.

### Blepharoplasty: Rejuvenating the Gaze
Blepharoplasty, also known as eyelid surgery, is a procedure aimed at correcting imperfections in the upper and lower eyelids.

These imperfections can include:
- Excess skin and wrinkles
- Fat bags
- Drooping eyelids

Blepharoplasty can be performed on the upper eyelids, lower eyelids, or both, depending on the patient's needs. The procedure involves removing excess skin, repositioning or removing fat bags, and adjusting eyelid muscles.

### Facelift: Restoring Firmness and Contour
A facelift, also known as rhytidectomy, is a surgical procedure aimed at correcting sagging skin and underlying tissues of the face and neck.

Over time, the skin loses elasticity, facial muscles weaken, and facial fat redistributes, resulting in:
- Sagging cheeks
- Loss of jaw contour
- Deep wrinkles
- Double chin

A facelift repositions facial tissues, removes excess skin, and restores a younger, more defined contour.

## Why Combine Blepharoplasty and Facelift?

Combining blepharoplasty and facelift offers a series of benefits that cannot be achieved with the procedures performed in isolation.

### Complete and Harmonious Facial Rejuvenation
While blepharoplasty focuses on the eye area, a facelift addresses skin and tissue sagging throughout the face and neck. By combining the two procedures, it is possible to obtain a more balanced and natural result, rejuvenating the entire face harmoniously.

### Comprehensive Treatment of Aging Signs
The combination allows treating a wider variety of aging signs, such as:
- Drooping eyelids and fat bags
- Skin sagging
- Wrinkles and expression lines
- Loss of facial volume

### More Natural and Long-Lasting Results
By repositioning facial tissues instead of just stretching the skin, a facelift provides more natural and long-lasting results. Blepharoplasty complements this result, rejuvenating the eye area and enhancing the beauty of the face as a whole. The [Modern Face](/en/blog/modern-face-concept-philosophy) philosophy, created by Dr. Robério Brandão, emphasizes the importance of rejuvenation that respects individuality and facial harmony.

### Correction of Specific Problems
In some cases, blepharoplasty may be necessary to correct specific problems, such as:
- Eyelid ptosis (drooping upper eyelid)
- Ectropion (lower eyelid turned outward)
- Entropion (lower eyelid turned inward)

These conditions can be corrected during the facelift, providing functional and aesthetic improvement.

## The Modern Face Philosophy in Procedure Combination

Dr. Robério Brandão, a renowned surgeon and creator of the Modern Face philosophy, believes that combining procedures must be carefully planned to meet each patient's individual needs.

### Prioritizing Naturalness and Harmony
In Modern Face, the goal is not just to eliminate wrinkles and sagging, but to restore the face's natural beauty, respecting its unique characteristics. The combination of blepharoplasty and facelift must be performed in a way that creates a balanced and harmonious result, without exaggeration or "plastic" stigmas.

### The Importance of Individualized Assessment
Every patient is unique, and their needs and expectations must be carefully evaluated before deciding on combining procedures. Dr. Robério emphasizes the importance of a detailed consultation, where the surgeon can examine the patient's facial structure, discuss their options, and create a personalized treatment plan.

### Minimally Invasive Techniques
In Modern Face, the preference is for minimally invasive techniques, which provide natural results with shorter recovery time and lower risk of complications. The [Endomidface](/en/blog/endomidface-complete-guide) technique, for example, allows for a midface lift with minimal incisions and optimized recovery.

## Step-by-Step of Blepharoplasty and Facelift Combination

Combining blepharoplasty and facelift is a complex procedure requiring careful planning and surgical skill.

### 1. Detailed Pre-Operative Assessment
The first step is a complete evaluation of the patient, including:
- Analysis of facial structure
- Evaluation of skin quality
- Examination of eyelids and vision
- Discussion of patient expectations

### 2. Personalized Surgical Planning
Based on the assessment, the surgeon develops an individualized treatment plan, defining:
- Which areas of the face will be treated with the facelift
- Which eyelids will undergo blepharoplasty
- Which surgical techniques will be used
- The order of procedures

### 3. Surgical Procedures
Surgery usually begins with blepharoplasty, followed by fibrous facelift.

#### Blepharoplasty
- Incisions are made in the natural creases of the eyelids
- Excess skin and fat bags are removed or repositioned
- Eyelid muscles are adjusted
- Incisions are closed with fine sutures

#### Facelift
- Incisions are made in discreet areas, such as the hairline and around the ears
- Skin is separated from underlying tissues
- Facial tissues are repositioned and fixed
- Excess skin is removed
- Incisions are closed

### 4. Post-Operative Recovery
After surgery, it is important to follow the surgeon's instructions to ensure a smooth recovery and optimized results.

These instructions may include:
- Rest
- Applying cold compresses
- Using medication for pain and inflammation
- Care with incisions
- Avoiding sun exposure
- Attending follow-up appointments

## Safety First

Combining blepharoplasty and facelift is a safe procedure when performed by a qualified and experienced plastic surgeon. However, as with any surgery, there are risks involved.

### Choosing a Qualified Surgeon
Choosing a board-certified plastic surgeon is fundamental to minimizing risks and ensuring a satisfactory result.

### Managing Risks
During the consultation, the surgeon will discuss the risks and benefits of combining procedures, as well as the measures that will be taken to minimize these risks. It is important to follow all surgeon instructions to ensure safe recovery and optimized results.

## Results and Expectations

Combining blepharoplasty and facelift can provide remarkable results in facial rejuvenation.

## Relevant Anatomy for This Procedure

Anatomical knowledge is fundamental to understand how results are achieved safely and effectively.

### Key Structures

The face is composed of layers that must be understood together:

- **Skin**: the most superficial layer, reflecting aging through wrinkles and sagging
- **Subcutaneous tissue**: contains fat that redistributes with age
- **SMAS (Superficial Musculo-Aponeurotic System)**: fundamental layer connecting muscles to skin
- **Facial muscles**: responsible for expression and dynamic support
- **Retaining ligaments**: anchor skin to the facial skeleton
- **Facial nerves**: control movement and sensation

### Surgical Planes

In the Modern Face philosophy, we work in specific planes:

- **Superficial plane**: above the SMAS, used in less invasive procedures
- **Deep plane (sub-SMAS)**: below the SMAS, allows for longer-lasting results
- **Subcutaneous plane**: used for fat grafting and fat treatment

### Why This Matters

Understanding anatomy explains:

- Why certain procedures last longer than others
- How natural results are achieved
- Why the surgeon's experience is crucial
- How complications can be avoided

> "Respect for anatomy is what separates a natural result from an artificial one. In Modern Face, every structure has its role and must be preserved or repositioned with precision." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## Comparison: Techniques and Approaches

Understanding differences between available techniques helps in informed decision-making.

### Overview of Approaches

| Aspect | Traditional Techniques | Modern Face |
|---|---|---|
| **Surgical plane** | Generally superficial | Deep (sub-SMAS) |
| **Traction vector** | Predominantly lateral | Vertically anatomically correct |
| **Incisions** | Extensive, multiple areas | Minimal, strategically positioned |
| **Recovery** | 2-4 weeks | 7-14 days on average |
| **Durability** | 5-7 years | 10-15 years |
| **Naturalness** | Risk of "stretched" look | Preserves natural expression |

### Advantages of the Modern Approach

The Modern Face technique offers specific benefits:

- **More natural results**: vertical vector respects facial anatomy
- **Shorter recovery time**: minimally invasive techniques speed healing
- **Superior durability**: work in the deep plane offers longer-lasting support
- **Less visible scars**: strategic and smaller incisions
- **Preservation of expressiveness**: face remains natural and mobile

### When Each Technique is Indicated

Technique choice depends on individual factors:

- **Degree of aging**: more advanced cases may require more comprehensive approaches
- **Areas of concern**: midface, lower face, or neck have specific techniques
- **Patient expectations**: balance between desired result and acceptable recovery
- **History of previous procedures**: revisions require special planning

## Detailed Post-Operative Care

The procedure's success depends on both the surgical technique and post-operative care.

### First Days: Critical Phase

In this phase, small precautions make a big difference:

- **Elevated rest**: keep head elevated at 30-45° even when sleeping
- **Cold compresses**: apply in the first 48h to reduce edema
- **Strict medication**: follow exactly the prescribed schedules
- **Light diet**: prefer soft foods and avoid excessive chewing
- **Abundant hydration**: water helps with tissue recovery

### First Week: Intermediate Care

As healing advances:

- **Careful hygiene**: clean the area as directed, without rubbing
- **Avoid sun exposure**: use a hat and sunscreen when going out is necessary
- **Gentle facial movements**: avoid exaggerated expressions
- **Adequate sleep**: the body recovers mainly during sleep
- **Avoid alcohol and tobacco**: both impair healing

### Weeks 2-4: Gradual Return

Return to activities should be progressive:

- **Light activities**: short walks are allowed
- **Remote work**: can be resumed as comfortable
- **Light makeup**: generally allowed after 2 weeks
- **Moderate exercise**: only with medical clearance
- **Lymphatic drainage**: indicated to accelerate recovery

### What to Avoid

Throughout the recovery period:

- Direct sun exposure on operated areas
- Intense physical activities before clearance
- Alcohol consumption in the first 2 weeks
- Smoking (ideally stop 4 weeks before and after)
- Non-prescribed anti-inflammatories
- Sudden movements with the face

## Conclusion

Combining blepharoplasty and facelift is a powerful tool to rejuvenate the face and restore self-confidence. By choosing a qualified and experienced surgeon, and following a personalized treatment plan, it is possible to achieve natural and long-lasting results that enhance each patient's individual beauty.
