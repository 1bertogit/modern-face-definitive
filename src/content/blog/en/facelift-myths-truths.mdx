faq:
  - question: "Does facelift really work?"
    answer: "Yes. Facelift is gold standard for correcting facial ptosis. Unlike non-surgical treatments that camouflage, facelift repositions tissues structurally. Results are visible and lasting."
  - question: "Why do some people look strange?"
    answer: "Usually due to inadequate technique: excessive tension, wrong vectors (too lateral), or poorly calibrated additional procedures. With proper technique and conservative planning, this is avoidable."
  - question: "Is it true result 'drops' quickly?"
    answer: "No. Well-executed results last 8-12 years. Perception of 'dropping quickly' may come from superficial techniques (skin only) that indeed have shorter durability. Techniques addressing SMAS or deep plane are more lasting."
  - question: "Does facelift leave 'stretched' face?"
    answer: "Only if poorly executed. 'Windswept' (stretched) appearance results from excessive lateral vectors. Modern techniques use vertical vectors that rejuvenate without creating unnatural lateral tension."
  - question: "Is it true celebrities have facelift and it looks natural?"
    answer: "Yes, many celebrities have facelift with natural results — you simply don't notice because it stayed natural. 'Visible' cases are poorly executed ones. Good facelift is invisible."

## Why So Many Myths?
Facelift carries decades of misinformation. Part comes from poor results of old
techniques. Part comes from poorly operated celebrities. Part is simply fear of unknown
amplified by internet.
Result? Patients who would benefit enormously from procedure postpone for years, or opt
for less effective treatments due to fear of myths that don't match current reality.
