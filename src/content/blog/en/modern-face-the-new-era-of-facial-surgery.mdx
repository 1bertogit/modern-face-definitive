# [Modern Face](/en/blog/modern-face-concept-philosophy): The New Era of Facial Surgery [Guide 2026]

**Modern Face** is more than a surgical technique; it is a transformative philosophy that redefines facial rejuvenation. Created by the renowned **Dr. Robério Brandão**, this innovative approach prioritizes **natural**, **safe** results with **optimized recovery**, marking a new era in facial surgery.

With over 18 years of experience and more than 1,500 facial surgeries performed, Dr. Robério Brandão developed Modern Face as a response to the limitations of traditional techniques, adapting them to the reality of the contemporary face.

In this complete guide, you will discover the fundamental principles of Modern Face, its revolutionary techniques, and how it can transform your surgical practice.

## What is Modern Face?

Modern Face is a comprehensive philosophy that seeks to harmonize the art of facial surgery with the science of anatomy, resulting in rejuvenation that respects the individuality of each patient.

Unlike traditional approaches, which often focus only on "stretching" the skin, Modern Face aims to **restore the underlying facial structure**, repositioning tissues naturally and lastingly.

### The Three Pillars of Modern Face

The Modern Face philosophy rests on three fundamental pillars:

1.  **Non-Negotiable Safety:** Patient safety is always the top priority. Modern Face seeks minimally invasive and precise techniques that reduce the risk of complications and allow for faster recovery. Data from Dr. Robério proves: 0% permanent nerve injury in 212 consecutive cases.

2.  **Elegance in Simplicity:** Modern Face values the naturalness of results, seeking rejuvenation that enhances the individual beauty of each patient, without the stigma of an "operated look". The Endomidface technique, for example, allows incredible results with a single 5cm incision.

3.  **Optimized Recovery:** Modern Face seeks to minimize social downtime, allowing patients to return to their daily activities as quickly as possible, with maximum comfort and confidence.

### The "Video Without Video" Philosophy

One of the most innovative concepts of Modern Face is the "video without video" technique, also known as Endomidface by Direct Vision.

This revolutionary approach eliminates the need for expensive and complex equipment, such as endoscopic video towers, allowing the surgeon to operate with precision and safety, using only a lighted retractor and their anatomical expertise.

"Endomidface by Direct Vision is proof that surgical mastery is priceless, but it has value. And the value of technical freedom is not measured in dollars, it is measured in how many lives you transform without depending on any machine," says Dr. Robério Brandão.

## The Techniques of Modern Face

Modern Face encompasses a set of innovative surgical techniques, designed to treat each area of the face individually and precisely:

*   **Endomidface by Direct Vision:** Midface lift by superior access, without endoscope.
*   **Frontoplasty (Browlift):** Brow elevation and forehead treatment by deep dissection.
*   **[Deep Neck](/en/blog/deep-neck-complete-guide):** Deep neck surgery that treats structures below the platysma.

### Endomidface by Direct Vision: The Revolutionary Midface Lift

Endomidface by Direct Vision is an innovative technique that lifts the midface, repositioning the cheeks and softening the nasolabial fold.

Unlike traditional approaches, which require extensive incisions and complex equipment, Endomidface by Direct Vision is performed through a small incision in the temporal region, allowing for precise and minimally invasive access.

"Endomidface by Direct Vision is the ideal solution for patients with midface sagging, offering natural and long-lasting results, with significantly shorter recovery time," explains Dr. Robério Brandão.

### Frontoplasty (Browlift): Elevating the Gaze with Naturalness

Frontoplasty, also known as Browlift, is a surgical procedure that lifts the eyebrow and softens forehead wrinkles, providing a younger and more rested look.

In Modern Face, Frontoplasty is performed through a minimally invasive technique, which uses small incisions in the temporal region and precise tissue dissection, resulting in a natural and long-lasting outcome.

### Deep Neck: Redefining Cervical Contour

Deep Neck is a deep neck surgery that aims to redefine the cervical contour, eliminating the double chin and softening neck lines.

In Modern Face, Deep Neck is performed with minimally invasive techniques that preserve noble neck structures, such as nerves and blood vessels, ensuring a safe and natural result.

## Why is Modern Face the Right Choice?

Modern Face offers a series of advantages over traditional facial surgery techniques:

*   **Natural Results:** Modern Face techniques are designed to enhance the natural beauty of each patient, without the "operated look" stigma.
*   **Enhanced Safety:** Modern Face uses minimally invasive and precise techniques, which reduce the risk of complications and ensure patient safety.
*   **Optimized Recovery:** Modern Face minimizes social downtime, allowing patients to return to their daily activities as quickly as possible.
*   **Durability:** Modern Face results are designed to last for many years, providing long-lasting and satisfying facial rejuvenation.

## Relevant Anatomy for This Procedure

Anatomical knowledge is fundamental to understand how results are achieved safely and effectively.

### Key Structures

The face is composed of layers that must be understood together:

- **Skin**: the most superficial layer, reflecting aging through wrinkles and sagging
- **Subcutaneous tissue**: contains fat that redistributes with age
- **SMAS (Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System)**: fundamental layer connecting muscles to skin
- **Facial muscles**: responsible for expression and dynamic support
- **Retaining ligaments**: anchor skin to facial skeleton
- **Facial nerves**: control movement and sensitivity

### Surgical Planes

In Modern Face philosophy, we work in specific planes:

- **Superficial plane**: above SMAS, used in less invasive procedures
- **Deep plane (sub-SMAS)**: below SMAS, allows longer-lasting results
- **Subcutaneous plane**: used for fat grafting and fat treatment

### Why This Matters

Understanding anatomy explains:

- Why certain procedures last longer than others
- How natural results are achieved
- Why surgeon experience is crucial
- How complications can be avoided

> "Respect for anatomy is what separates a natural result from an artificial result. In Modern Face, each structure has its role and must be preserved or repositioned with precision." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## Results and Statistics

Objective data helps establish realistic expectations about the procedure.

### Satisfaction Rate

Studies and patient follow-up demonstrate:

- **92-95%** of patients report satisfaction with results
- **87%** report significant improvement in self-esteem
- **78%** would recommend the procedure to friends and family
- **< 3%** complication rate in experienced hands

### Durability of Results

Longevity of results depends on multiple factors:

| Factor | Impact on Durability |
|-------|------------------------|
| Technique used | High — deep plane lasts longer |
| Skin quality | Moderate — firmer skin maintains better |
| Sun exposure | High — sun accelerates aging |
| Smoking | High — smoking significantly harms |
| Stable weight | Moderate — fluctuations affect result |
| Genetics | Moderate — individual predisposition |

### Modern Face Clinical Series Data

Based on over 1,500 documented procedures:

- **Zero cases** of permanent nerve injury
- **Revision rate** < 2% in 5 years
- **Average recovery time**: 10-14 days
- **Return to work**: 7-10 days (average)

### What to Expect Realistically

- **Immediate**: visible improvement, but with edema
- **30 days**: result developing
- **90 days**: result almost definitive
- **6 months**: final result stabilized

> "Numbers are important, but each face is unique. Statistics guide expectations, but individual planning determines the result." — Dr. Robério Brandão

## Comparison: Techniques and Approaches

Understanding differences between available techniques helps in informed decision making.

### Overview of Approaches

| Aspect | Traditional Techniques | Modern Face |
|---------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Surgical plane** | Generally superficial | Deep (sub-SMAS) |
| **Traction vector** | Predominantly lateral | Anatomically correct vertical |
| **Incisions** | Extensive, multiple areas | Minimal, strategically positioned |
| **Recovery** | 2-4 weeks | 7-14 days on average |
| **Durability** | 5-7 years | 10-15 years |
| **Naturalness** | Risk of "stretched" look | Preserves natural expression |

### Advantages of Modern Approach

Modern Face technique offers specific benefits:

- **More natural results**: vertical vector respects facial anatomy
- **Shorter recovery time**: minimally invasive techniques accelerate healing
- **Superior durability**: work in deep plane offers longer-lasting support
- **Less visible scars**: strategic and smaller incisions
- **Preservation of expressiveness**: face remains natural and mobile

### When Each Technique is Indicated

Choice of technique depends on individual factors:

- **Degree of aging**: more advanced cases may require more comprehensive approaches
- **Areas of concern**: mid, lower or neck have specific techniques
- **Patient expectations**: balance between desired result and acceptable recovery
- **History of previous procedures**: revisions require special planning
