# Facelift: How Long Does It Last? Complete Guide [2025]

The facelift, also known as rhytidoplasty, is a surgical procedure aimed at rejuvenating the face's appearance by correcting skin sagging, smoothing wrinkles, and restoring more youthful contours. One of the most frequent questions among patients considering this surgery is: how long do the results last?

In this complete guide, Dr. Robério Brandão, creator of the Modern Face philosophy and specialist in minimally invasive facelift techniques, explores the durability of the facelift, the factors influencing it, and strategies to maximize your results. Additionally, we will compare different techniques, including the revolutionary [Endomidface by Direct Vision](/en/blog/endomidface-complete-guide), so you can make an informed decision and achieve long-lasting and natural facial rejuvenation.

## Facelift Durability: What to Expect

On average, a successful facelift can last from 7 to 10 years. However, it is important to emphasize that this is only an estimate, and actual durability can vary significantly from person to person. Various factors, such as the surgical technique used, patient age, skin quality, and lifestyle, play a crucial role in result longevity.

It is important to have realistic expectations and understand that a facelift does not stop the aging process. The skin will continue to change over time, but the surgery provides a "reset", allowing the patient to age from a more youthful base and with more defined contours.

### Factors Influencing Durability

Facelift durability is influenced by a combination of intrinsic factors (related to the patient) and extrinsic factors (related to technique and post-operative care).

*   **Surgical Technique:** The technique used is one of the most important factors. Techniques acting on deeper facial layers, such as [Endomidface](/en/blog/endomidface-complete-guide) and Deep Plane, tend to offer longer-lasting results than techniques that only pull the skin superficially.
*   **Patient Age:** The age at which the patient undergoes the facelift can influence durability. Younger patients, with greater skin elasticity, generally present longer-lasting results.
*   **Skin Quality:** Skin quality, including its thickness, elasticity, and degree of sun damage, affects how it responds to surgery and how it maintains its results over time.
*   **Lifestyle:** Habits such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and unprotected sun exposure can accelerate the aging process and decrease facelift durability.
*   **Post-Operative Care:** Adherence to post-operative care recommended by the surgeon, such as avoiding sun exposure, maintaining a healthy diet, and using appropriate skincare products, can prolong results.

### Surgical Techniques and Durability: A Comparative Analysis

Different facelift techniques offer different degrees of durability. It is important to discuss options with your surgeon to choose the technique best suited to your needs and expectations.

[Endomidface by Direct Vision](/en/blog/endomidface-complete-guide), a technique developed by Dr. Robério Brandão, offers an innovative approach to facial rejuvenation, combining long-lasting results with a faster and minimally invasive recovery.

"The beauty of Modern Face lies in combining high-impact results with techniques that respect anatomy and minimize risks," states Dr. Robério Brandão.

This technique stands out for:

*   **Superior Access:** Acts on the mobile SMAS, bypassing fibrosis areas caused by biostimulators.
*   **Direct Vision:** Eliminates dependence on expensive equipment, such as endoscopic video towers.
*   **Vertical Vector:** Promotes natural rejuvenation, without the "stretched face" stigma.

## Prolonging Results: Care and Maintenance

Although a facelift offers significant results, it is fundamental to adopt measures to prolong its durability and maintain a rejuvenated appearance.

*   **Adequate Skincare:** Use high-quality skincare products, recommended by your dermatologist, to hydrate, nourish, and protect the skin.
*   **Sun Protection:** Sun exposure is one of the main factors contributing to skin aging. Use sunscreen daily, even on cloudy days, and avoid prolonged sun exposure.
*   **Healthy Habits:** Adopt a healthy lifestyle, with a balanced diet, regular physical exercise, adequate sleep, and stress control.
*   **Avoid Smoking:** Smoking impairs blood circulation and accelerates the skin aging process, decreasing facelift durability.
*   **Complementary Procedures:** Complementary procedures, such as hyaluronic acid fillers and botulinum toxin application, can help smooth fine wrinkles and expression lines, complementing facelift results.

### What Happens When the Facelift Loses Its Effect?

Even with the best care, signs of aging will inevitably reappear over time. When this happens, there are several options to revitalize appearance:

*   **Mini-Lift:** A less invasive procedure that can be performed to retouch the results of the original facelift.
*   **Fillers:** Hyaluronic acid fillers can be used to restore lost volume and smooth wrinkles and expression lines.
*   **Botulinum Toxin:** Botulinum toxin application can help relax facial muscles and smooth dynamic wrinkles, such as crow's feet and forehead lines.
*   **Other Procedures:** Other procedures, such as lasers and chemical peels, can improve skin texture and tone, complementing facelift results.

*   **Choose the most appropriate technique:** Assess your individual needs and recommend the technique offering the best long-term results.
*   **Perform surgery with precision:** Execute surgery with precision, minimizing tissue damage and optimizing results.
*   **Minimize complications:** Adopt measures to prevent and treat complications, ensuring smooth recovery and long-lasting results.

## Post-Operative Warning Signs

Knowing warning signs allows early identification of any complication and quick action.

### When to Seek Surgeon Immediately

Some signs require urgent medical evaluation:

- **Active bleeding** that does not cease with light compression for 10-15 minutes
- **Fever** above 38°C, especially if accompanied by chills
- **Intense and sudden pain** not controlled with prescribed medication

- **Purulent discharge** with unpleasant odor

### Normal Signs (Do Not Worry)

These symptoms are expected and do not require concern:

- **Moderate edema** in first days, especially in morning
- **Ecchymosis** (purple spots) that change color progressively
- **Temporary tingling or numbness** in operated area
- **Pulling sensation** as tissues heal
- **Small temporary asymmetries** due to irregular edema
- **Difficulty smiling** or moving face in first days

### Safety Protocol

In case of doubt, follow this protocol:

1. **Document** — take photos and note symptoms
2. **Contact** — call surgeon's team
3. **Do not self-medicate** — avoid non-prescribed medications
4. **Keep calm** — most complications are manageable

> "In Modern Face, each patient receives a direct communication channel for emergencies. Safety is not luxury, is priority." — Dr. Robério Brandão
