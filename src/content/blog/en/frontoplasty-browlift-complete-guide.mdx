faq:
  - question: "What is frontoplasty (browlift)?"
    answer: "Frontoplasty, also called browlift or forehead lift, is the surgery that elevates the eyebrows and rejuvenates the forehead region. It corrects brow ptosis (droopy eyebrow), forehead and glabellar wrinkles. The Modern Face technique uses temporal access with subperiosteal dissection."
  - question: "What's the difference between endoscopic and direct vision frontoplasty?"
    answer: "Endoscopic frontoplasty uses a camera and smaller incisions, but requires expensive equipment and has a steep learning curve. The direct vision technique (Modern Face) uses the same temporal access as Endomidface, allowing complete visualization without specialized equipment."
  - question: "Does frontoplasty leave visible scars?"
    answer: "Incisions are positioned in the scalp (temporal access), completely hidden by hair. Even in patients with receding hairlines, scars remain in low-visibility areas. After healing, they're virtually undetectable."
  - question: "What's the recovery from frontoplasty?"
    answer: "Frontal and periorbital edema is expected for 7-14 days. Ecchymosis may descend to eyelids. Temporary numbness in forehead region is common. Most return to social activities in 10-14 days. Final result in 2-3 months."
  - question: "Can frontoplasty be combined with other surgeries?"
    answer: "Yes, it's frequently combined with upper blepharoplasty, Endomidface and Deep Neck for complete facial rejuvenation. Integration with Endomidface is particularly elegant as both use the same temporal access."
  - question: "Who is a candidate for frontoplasty?"
    answer: "Ideal candidates present: brow ptosis (eyebrow below orbital rim), excess upper eyelid skin due to brow ptosis, deep forehead wrinkles, tired or sad appearance due to eyebrow position."
  - question: "Does frontoplasty resolve forehead wrinkles?"
    answer: "Frontoplasty improves forehead wrinkles by repositioning tissues and reducing the need for muscle contraction. However, very deep wrinkles may need complementary treatment with botulinum toxin or resurfacing."
  - question: "Is the result of frontoplasty permanent?"
    answer: "The result is long-lasting (5-10+ years), but doesn't prevent continued aging. The elevated eyebrow position is maintained, but new aging signs may emerge over time. Complementary procedures can be performed later."

## The Upper Third: Framing the Face
The forehead region and eyebrows are the "framing" of the face. Well-positioned eyebrows
convey youth, alertness and expressiveness. Ptotic (droopy) eyebrows create a tired, sad
or angry appearance — even when the person isn't.
**Frontoplasty** (or browlift) is the surgery that corrects brow ptosis, elevating
the eyebrows to a youthful position. Historically, it was performed through a coronal incision
(ear-to-ear) or, more recently, endoscopically.
The **Modern Face** technique proposes a third way: frontoplasty via **temporal access with subperiosteal dissection**. This approach eliminates the need for expensive endoscopic equipment while
maintaining excellent results and integrating perfectly with [Endomidface.
> "The upper third is often neglected in facelift. However, rejuvenating mid-face and neck
> while keeping ptotic eyebrows creates disharmony. Frontoplasty completes rejuvenation."

## Relevant Anatomy
### Ideal Eyebrow Position
The "ideal" eyebrow position varies by gender and individual characteristics:
#### 👨 Male
- • Position at orbital rim level
- • Straighter/horizontal shape
- • Subtle or absent peak
#### 👩 Female
- • Position above orbital rim
- • Arched shape
- • Peak in lateral third
### Critical Structures
#### Frontal (Temporal) Branch of Facial Nerve
Innervates frontalis muscle. Injury causes inability to raise eyebrow. Crosses
zygomatic arch in temporoparietal fascia.
#### Supraorbital and Supratrochlear Nerves
Provide forehead sensation. Emerge from orbital rim. Injury causes frontal
anesthesia.
#### Temporal Fusion Line
Where superficial temporal fascia fuses with periosteum. Crucial landmark for safe
dissection.

## Modern Face Technique: Step by Step
#### 💡 Integration with Endomidface
Modern Face frontoplasty uses the SAME temporal access as Endomidface. When combined,
a single access allows rejuvenation of upper third (eyebrows) and middle (malar)
simultaneously.
1
### Markings
Mark current and desired eyebrow position. Identify supraorbital foramen. Plan
temporal incision (same as Endomidface if combined).
2
### Temporal Access
Incision in temporal scalp. Dissection through temporoparietal fascia until
identifying deep temporal fascia (shiny white plane).
3
### Zygomatic Arch Release
Subperiosteal dissection over zygomatic arch. Protects frontal branch of facial
nerve which is superficial at this point.
4
### Frontal Dissection
Subperiosteal extension to frontal region. Direct visualization of structures.
Release up to near orbital rim.
5
### Rim Release
Careful release of attachments at orbital rim. Preserve supraorbital nerve. This
step allows adequate mobilization.
6
### Elevation and Fixation
Elevate eyebrow to desired position. Fixation with sutures in deep temporal fascia
(vertical vector). Verify symmetry.
7
### Closure
Scalp closure. Compressive dressing. If combined with Endomidface, dressing is
joint.

## Indications and Contraindications
### Indications
- ✓ Brow ptosis (droopy eyebrow)
- ✓ Excess eyelid skin due to brow ptosis
- ✓ Tired/sad appearance due to eyebrow position
- ✓ Deep forehead wrinkles
- ✓ Eyebrow asymmetry
- ✓ Desire for upper third rejuvenation
### Contraindications
- ✗ Very high hairline (consider coronal)
- ✗ Advanced frontal alopecia
- ✗ Expectation of exaggerated elevation
- ✗ True eyelid ptosis (requires blepharoplasty)
- ✗ General contraindications for surgery
