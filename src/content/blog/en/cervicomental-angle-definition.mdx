## What is the Cervicomental Angle?
The **cervicomental angle** is the angle formed between the neck plane and the
submental line (below the chin). In youthful faces, this angle is acute and well-defined. With
aging, it becomes obtuse and undefined.
### Ideal Angle:
- • **Aesthetic ideal:** 90-105 degrees
- • **Acceptable:** 105-120 degrees
- • **Compromised:** 120 degrees (loss of definition)
## Factors Affecting the Angle
- • Hyoid bone position
- • Chin projection
- • Submental fat volume
- • Platysma muscle tone
- • Skin laxity
- • Submandibular gland volume
## Surgical Treatment
Improving the cervicomental angle requires a multifactorial approach: submental lipectomy,
platysmaplasty, glandular repositioning/containment (Glandular Sling) and, when necessary,
chin implant. These procedures are core components of the
[Deep Neck](/en/techniques/deep-neck) technique.
