        <p class="drop-cap">
          To understand Modern Face®, we need to understand where we came from. Facial surgery
          wasn't born ready — it evolved through generations of surgeons who questioned,
          experimented, and refined. Each era brought advances. Each era left limitations.
        </p>

        <p>
          What we do today is only possible because giants came before us. But honoring the past
          doesn't mean blindly repeating it. It means building on it.

      <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-warmGray mt-20">
        <h2 class="font-serif text-primary-900">What Each Era Taught Us</h2>

        <h3 class="font-serif text-primary-900">From SMAS we learned:</h3>
        <p>
          That there is a deep layer that sustains results. That pulling only skin doesn't work
          long-term. That deep anatomy is the secret to durability.
        </p>

        <h3 class="font-serif text-primary-900">From Deep Plane we learned:</h3>
        <p>
          That the sub-SMAS plane is safer than it seems — when you know the anatomy. That less skin
          tension means better scars. That vertical vectors are superior to lateral ones.
        </p>

        <h3 class="font-serif text-primary-900">From the endoscopic era we learned:</h3>
        <p>
          That smaller incisions are possible. That magnified visualization has value — but also
          cost. That technology dependency has risks.
        </p>

        <h3 class="font-serif text-primary-900">From the filler era we learned:</h3>
        <p>
          That patients want less invasive procedures. That volume isn't the only answer. And,
          critically, that biostimulators alter anatomy in ways that old techniques didn't
          anticipate.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-serif text-primary-900">The Modern Face Challenge</h2>

        <p>
          Here's the problem: techniques developed between 1970 and 2010 were created for <em
            >native</em
          > faces — without biostimulators, without years of hyaluronic acid, without repeated fillers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, <strong class="text-primary-900"
            >90% of the faces we operate on have already been treated with injectables</strong
          >. The anatomical planes are altered. The fibrosis is different. The risks are different.
        </p>

        <p>
          Blindly applying 1990s techniques to 2024 faces isn't tradition — it's negligence.
          Evolution is mandatory.
        </p>

            "Honoring the masters of the past doesn't mean repeating their techniques. It means
            applying their mindset — of questioning and evolution — to present challenges."

        <h2 class="font-serif text-primary-900">Why Modern Face®</h2>

        <p>
          Modern Face® doesn't discard what came before. It integrates. It takes the best of each
          era — the understanding of SMAS, the safety of deep plane, the philosophy of minimal
          invasion — and adapts for today's reality.
        </p>

        <p>
          It adds what was missing: direct vision as an alternative to the endoscope. Protocols for
          faces with biostimulators. Systematization of knowledge to shorten the learning curve.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's not rupture. It's natural evolution. The next chapter of a story that began 50 years
          ago.
