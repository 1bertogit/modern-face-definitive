        <p class="drop-cap">
          Why is excellence in facial surgery a secret guarded by a few? Why does it take a surgeon
          10-15 years to feel safe in the deep plane? Why do complications that could be avoided
          still happen?
        </p>

        <p>
          These questions haunted me for years. And the answers I found led me to create Modern
          Face®.
        </p>

        <h2 class="heading-3">The Problem</h2>

        <p>
          Facial surgery in deep planes is powerful. The results are superior and more lasting. But
          the traditional teaching model is broken:
        </p>

        <ul class="space-y-3">
          <li>
            <strong class="text-primary-900">Learning by survival:</strong> Surgeons learn from their
            own mistakes — and often from complications on their patients.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="text-primary-900">Guarded knowledge:</strong> The best techniques stay restricted
            to a few centers, transmitted like family secrets.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="text-primary-900">Outdated techniques:</strong> Methods developed for native
            faces don't account for the reality of modern faces with biostimulators.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The result? Talented surgeons give up on the deep plane out of fear. Patients who could
          have excellent results settle for less. And knowledge that should evolve stagnates.
        </p>

        <h2 class="heading-3">Who This Is For</h2>

        <p>Modern Face® is not for everyone. It's for the surgeon who:</p>

        <ul class="space-y-3">
          <li>
            <strong class="text-primary-900">Knows they can do more</strong> — who has mastered the basics
            and feels the call to evolve
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="text-primary-900">Is tired of courses that don't deliver</strong> — weekend
            promises that don't translate into clinical security
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="text-primary-900">Values method over magic</strong> — who understands that
            consistency comes from process, not talent
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="text-primary-900">Prioritizes patient safety</strong> — who is not willing
            to accept "acceptable" complication rates
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="heading-3">The Commitment</h2>

        <p>
          Modern Face® is not a weekend course. It's not a certification that looks good on the
          resume. It's a commitment to a different way of practicing facial surgery.
        </p>

        <p>
          We believe that excellence should not be exclusive. That patient safety is non-negotiable.
          That knowledge grows when shared.
