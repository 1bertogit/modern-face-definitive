          The question every surgeon asks — and the answer that changed my practice.

        <p class="drop-cap">
          When I present the Endomidface by Direct Vision, the first reaction is always the same:
          "But Dr. Robério, isn't this a step backward? Isn't abandoning the endoscope going back in
          time?"
        </p>

        <p>It's a fair question. And it deserves an honest answer.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-3">The Myth of Linear Progress</h2>

        <p>
          There's an implicit belief in medicine that "more technology = better results." The
          endoscope looks modern. The video tower impresses. The patient feels they're receiving
          "the most advanced treatment."
        </p>

        <p>
          But technology is a tool, not an end. The right question isn't "which equipment to use?" —
          it's <strong class="text-primary-900"
            >"what gives me the best result with maximum safety?"</strong
          >
        </p>

        <h2 class="heading-3">What I Lost with the Endoscope</h2>

        <p>
          For years, I operated with endoscopy. I mastered the technique. I had consistent results.
          But something bothered me:
        </p>

        <ul class="space-y-3">
          <li>
            <strong class="text-primary-900">Hand-eye dissociation:</strong> You look at a monitor while
            your hands work somewhere else. The brain needs to constantly translate.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="text-primary-900">Loss of tactile feedback:</strong> The camera shows, but
            doesn't feel. The difference between "almost on the nerve" and "on the nerve" is sometimes
            millimetric.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="text-primary-900">Equipment dependency:</strong> Tower malfunction? Camera
            fogged? Surgery compromised.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="text-primary-900">Cruel learning curve:</strong> 50, 80, 100 cases to feel
            real confidence. How many avoidable complications along the way?
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="heading-3">What I Gained with Direct Vision</h2>

        <p>
          The transition wasn't immediate. It was years of technical evolution, refining accesses,
          lighting, positioning. Until arriving at a method that offers:
        </p>

        <ul class="space-y-3">
          <li>
            <strong class="text-primary-900">Simultaneous tactile + visual feedback:</strong>
            You see AND feel. At the same time. In the same plane.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="text-primary-900">Reduced learning curve:</strong> 15-30 cases for safety.
            Not 100.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="text-primary-900">Total autonomy:</strong> I don't depend on expensive equipment,
            camera-trained assistant, or luck with technology.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="text-primary-900">Immediate adaptation:</strong> Unexpected anatomy? I adjust
            on the spot. No time lost repositioning camera.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="heading-3">The Numbers Speak</h2>

        <p>
          212 consecutive cases of Endomidface by Direct Vision.
          <strong class="text-primary-900">Zero permanent nerve injury.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          This is not luck. It's method. It's the logical consequence of a technique that
          prioritizes safety over impression.

      <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-warmGray">
        <h2 class="heading-3">The Right Question</h2>

        <p>
          So no, direct vision is not a step backward. It's evolution. It's understanding that the
          best instrument is the one that connects you to the patient — not the one that separates
          you from them.
        </p>

        <p>
          The question isn't "endoscope or not?". It's: <strong class="text-primary-900">
            "what allows me to operate with maximum safety and consistent results?"</strong
          >
        </p>

        <p>For me, after 18 years, the answer is clear.</p>
