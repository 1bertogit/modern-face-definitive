      <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-warmGray">
        <p class="drop-cap">
          There's an unwritten tradition in medicine: valuable knowledge is guarded. Protected.
          Passed in droplets to a chosen few. "I did a fellowship with so-and-so" becomes currency.
          "I learned directly from the master" becomes a credential.
        </p>

        <p>
          I understand the logic. Knowledge is power. Exclusivity generates value. If everyone
          knows, my competitive advantage disappears.
        </p>

        <p>But this logic has a cost. And the patients pay it.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-3">The Decision</h2>

        <p>
          At some point in my journey, I had to choose. I could guard what I learned. Protect my
          "competitive advantage." Be the only one in the region to operate safely in the deep
          plane.
        </p>

        <p>Or I could document. Systematize. Teach. Multiply.</p>

        <p>
          The choice was easy when I looked at reality: I am one. I operate, at most, a few hundred
          patients per year. If I train 50 surgeons who operate with the same safety, the impact
          multiplies exponentially.

        <h2 class="heading-3">What This Means in Practice</h2>

        <p>
          Sharing knowledge isn't doing a weekend course and releasing the student into the world.
          It's creating a continuous learning ecosystem:
        </p>

        <ul class="space-y-3">
          <li>
            <strong class="text-primary-900">Structured training:</strong>
            From basic to advanced, with clear and measurable stages.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="text-primary-900">Ongoing mentorship:</strong>
            Post-course follow-up. Case discussions. Real support.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="text-primary-900">Community of practice:</strong>
            Connected surgeons, exchanging experiences, evolving together.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="text-primary-900">Constant updates:</strong>
            Technique evolves. Training too. Those who learned 5 years ago continue receiving updates.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="heading-3">The Invitation</h2>

        <p>
          If you're a surgeon and feel you can do more — that there's a next level of safety and
          results you haven't yet achieved — consider this an invitation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Not to follow a guru. Not to blindly replicate a technique. But to learn a method,
          understand the principles, and then make your own evolution.
        </p>

        <p>Knowledge doesn't diminish when shared. It multiplies.</p>
